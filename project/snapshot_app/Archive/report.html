src=&quot;https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/images/uploads/authors/Fuel_Watch_moving_eyes.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is happening with UK fuel prices?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prices at the top of this page are the latest average petrol, diesel and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) prices across supermarket and independent forecourts in the UK, and are updated daily where data is available.

Try these tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get to know the filling stations close to where you live and work&lt;/strong&gt; - presuming there is some competition between retailers, which seem to be competitive on price? Even taking a small detour to visit a cheap forecourt can save you as much as a few pence for every litre. Over one tank that’s noticeable: over 12 months’ motoring, that’s a saving that could stretch into the hundreds. And look beyond the supermarkets too - some independent retailers can be extremely cost-competitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take advantage of  supermarket price wars&lt;/strong&gt; – it can save you a useful amount at the pumps. The big grocery chains often vie for your custom by cutting headline prices. You can discover the cheapest by keeping an eye on your local supermarket filling stations when you’re doing your shopping. Sometimes they’ll give out money off fuel vouchers at the till, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supermarkets – as well as other fuel retailers – run &lt;strong&gt;loyalty card schemes&lt;/strong&gt;, and while they might clog up your purse or wallet, they can come in handy in cutting fuel costs. The more you fill up, the more points you’ll accrue – you can then exchange these for vouchers off your next fill-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some credit card companies offer &lt;strong&gt;cashback&lt;/strong&gt; for spending money at filling stations. While it might not actually save you money at the pumps, it will offset higher petrol or diesel prices by putting something back in your account. Just remember to pay off your account within the month or your savings will be cancelled out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the main way to save money on fuel is to drive efficiently. Read our &lt;a href=&quot;/drive/advice/how-to/fuel-saving-tips/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guide to saving fuel&lt;/a&gt; for more tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Petrol prices Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Petrol prices&quot; src=&quot;https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/images/uploads/panel-images/Petrol_and_diesel_prices_1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the highest ever recorded petrol and diesel prices?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 13 April 2012, diesel prices hit a record high of 147.93p per litre on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 17 April 2012, unleaded prices hit a record high of 142.48p on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What factors influence the price we pay for fuel at the pumps?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price you pay for petrol and diesel at the pumps is governed by wholesale fuel prices, which in turn, are affected by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the global price of crude oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;supply and demand for crude oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;refinery production and capacity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the pound to dollar exchange rate, as refined fuel is sold in US dollars per metric tonne&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;distribution costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the margin fuel retailers decide to take&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fuel duty charged by the Government, currently 57.95p a litre&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VAT (20%) charged at the end of every forecourt fuel transaction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of these stay largely static - such as the fuel duty rate and VAT - others such as the oil price and dollar to sterling exchange rate can be very volatile. This explains why prices rise and fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is fuel taxed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total retail price paid at the pump includes a significant amount of tax – 57.95p per litre in fuel duty and 20% VAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the total proportion of tax we pay to the Treasury varies depending on the pump price. For instance, with fuel at 120p a litre at the pumps, 65% of the cost is tax. But at £1 a litre it rises to 75%, meaning 75p in every litre sold goes to for the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel duty raises more than £26bn a year, which together with VAT charged on fuel, vehicle tax and ‘showroom’ tax totals, means motorists contribute more than £40bn a year to the Government’s coffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How much fuel does the UK use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Petroleum Industry Association reports that each day, 46m litres of petrol and 74m litres of diesel are sold in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to HM Revenue and Customs data for 2015, 46bn litres of fuel were used by drivers – 17.3bn litres of petrol and 28.8bn litres of diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How much fuel do we use in the UK?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows how much fuel has been sold in the UK since 2011 - the general trend has been for increased diesel sales and slightly falling petrol sales:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;highcharts-iframe&quot; src=&quot;https://cloud.highcharts.com/embed/HytMfBw8z/&quot; style=&quot;border: 0; width: 100%; height: 500px&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How low can fuel prices go?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to how low prices can go as tax – fuel duty at 57.95p a litre and VAT on the total price, including fuel duty – make up the lion’s share of the price of a litre. Even if the fuel was given away and the retailers didn’t take a margin, the price of a litre would still be 70p per litre – 57.95p duty, plus 20% VAT – 11.5p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high level of tax affects the price of a litre of fuel significantly. And, when the price of oil is falling it can also create a perception that pump prices are not reducing as much as they should because the lower the pump prices falls, the greater the percentage of tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How often do pump prices change?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pump prices change when there are significant and sustained increases or reductions in the wholesale price of petrol or diesel. Retailers can reflect these savings as often or as infrequently as they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality though the retail fuel market tends to be led by the supermarkets, as despite only having around 16% of UK forecourts they are responsible for some 44% of total fuel sales, so we often see widespread cuts being passed on at the pumps at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other factor which affects when forecourt prices are changed is how frequently retailers buy their fuel. Retailers who use greater volumes tend to buy more frequently and are therefore tend to alter their prices more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the ‘rocket and feather’ effect, and is it true?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a term often applied to fuel prices to describe how they always appear to rise faster than they ever come down, i.e. they go up like a rocket but fall like a feather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RAC believes retailers have a reasonable record of passing on reductions in the wholesale price of fuel to motorists at the pump, but there are occasions where we think this could be carried out more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, retailers often seem to take more encouraging to reduce their prices when oil prices are falling than they do when oil goes the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the longer they hold off cutting pump prices when oil’s coming down, the better it is for their margins, and the reverse is also true: when the cost of a barrel of oil rises, the more they stand to lose if they don’t raise the forecourt price quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why do prices vary by region?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices can vary dramatically from region to region and even in towns that are only a few miles apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes fuel can even be cheaper in a more rural location than in an urban one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local retail dynamics also play a part. Local prices are very often driven by the presence of supermarkets keen to compete on price or an independent forecourt retailer that is determined to offer the cheapest fuel. If local supermarkets selling fuel don’t compete strongly on price this can in fact lead to motorists paying more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why are rural prices often higher?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While delivery costs tend not to play too large a part in the overall pump price, excessive distances from fuel terminals can have a significant effect on prices in rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason the Government has taken action to help some of the country’s most rural communities where the price of fuel is deemed to be negatively affecting residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012 it introduced a 5p rural fuel duty discount in the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, and the Isles of Scilly. In March 2015 this was extended to 10 rural mainland communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why are motorway fuel prices so much more expensive than everywhere else?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel at motorway services is generally up to 10p – and sometimes as much as 15p per litre – more expensive than the national average price of petrol and diesel. The RAC can see no reason why this should be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All fuel retailers purchase their fuel at the same wholesale price and then have to pay delivery costs on top. While these costs do not impact the pump price significantly they can in very remote areas. But in the case of motorway services it is, of course, even easier to deliver to them than it is to urban filling stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RAC believes it is simply a decision of motorway service station operators to charge such high prices and they are taking advantage of motorists having little option but to buy from them. We feel that motorway service operators need to be held to account and made to explain the reason for charging such high prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAC research has found that motorists feel held to ransom by the inflated fuel prices charged at motorway services and has urged motorway services operators to explain why they charge so much for something that is drastically cheaper everywhere else. Forty-four per cent said they only buy fuel at motorway services when they have no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five motorists surveyed by the RAC said only put in ‘just enough fuel to get by’ at a motorway services to then find a cheaper alternative later. The RAC argues that if they were to charge significantly less for their fuel, the number of drivers filling up to the top would increase dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many forecourts are there in the UK?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of 2016 there were around 8,500 filling stations in the UK. This number has reduced drastically from 1970 when there were more than 37,000. In the last decade some 170 forecourts have closed due to stiff competition and increased costs of complying with environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to 2015 statistics from the UK Petroleum Industry Association supermarkets dominate fuel sales, accounting 44% of the total fuel volume despite only operating 16% of the forecourts. Independents operate 62% of the country’s filling stations but are only responsible for 32% of fuel sold. The remainder is accounted for by oil company-run sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fw_latestreports&quot;&gt;UK fuel price reports (historic)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download our fuel price reports to share or print (in PDF format) below.

At the start of March a litre of unleaded cost 120.15p and diesel 122.19p, but the biggest fall in the price of a barrel of oil since last July ($3 – $55.31 on 1 March to $52.30 on 30 March) led the supermarkets to make two 2p-a-litre cuts in the course of the month, winding back prices to a similar level they started 2017 at and shaving £1.40p off a tank.  An average 55-litre family petrol car now costs £64.65 to fill up with diesel slightly higher at £65.75.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “March brought some much-needed spring cheer to motorists with a significant 2.5p a litre reduction in the average price at the pumps. While prices were static in February, the two months before that saw 5p a litre added, completing a year of rising average pump prices. March saw the biggest fall in the price of diesel since January 2016 and since November last year for petrol. “With longer days and the prospect of warmer weather many motorists will be making some longer journeys so lower fuel prices are very welcome but the big question is what will happen as we move towards the summer.  “Everything really hinges on the oil market and whether more is done to curb supply with a view to getting the price to rise. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with some non-members, have cut production, but their efforts have been undermined by the US ramping up its fracking production.  “The low oil price that gave rise to fuel being sold for under £1 a litre in January 2016 was all driven by OPEC over-producing to lower the oil price and stop US fracking activity but every week now more fracking rigs are coming online. This is no doubt causing a major headache for OPEC. It must decide whether to cut production further and allow the US to gain more market share as the oil price rises or reconsider returning to over producing and lowering the oil price to make fracking less financially viable and keeping its market share, albeit at a reduced price. “The strength of the pound against the dollar is also important as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars, but having suffered a big drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote the new norm seems to be a pound that is consistently worth $1.24. The absence of any further significant downward movement should mean fuel prices will be mostly decided by the oil market.” Regional fuel price variation Scotland enjoyed the biggest drop in the price of both petrol and diesel with a fall of 2.9p a litre, nicely ahead of the UK average of 2.6p. The North East has – for the second consecutive month – recorded the cheapest petrol and diesel prices in the UK with unleaded at an average of 116.50p and diesel at 118.53p at the end of March. The South East continues to sell the most expensive fuel in the land with a litre of petrol costing 118.38p and diesel 120.30p.

This is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel £11 more expensive than a year ago, but prices stabilise in February&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Mar 03, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;After two months of rises at the pumps, the price of petrol and diesel stabilised in February, according to\xa0RAC Fuel Watch\xa0data*. Unleaded finished the month at 120.23p a litre, a very slight increase on the figure of 120.05p seen on 1 February, and diesel at 122.25p, having started at 122.31p, meaning the country is still paying the most it has for fuel since December 2014. The stability has been brought about by the fact the two key price-determining factors – the price of oil and the sterling/dollar exchange rate – have both steadied, keeping wholesale prices in check. A barrel of oil averaged $55 throughout the month and the pound was worth on average $1.25. It now costs £66.13 to fill up an average 55-litre family car with petrol compared to £55.91 a year ago when the average price nationally was 101.65p. A tank of diesel is now £67.27 compared to £55.72 12 months ago when a litre averaged 101.31p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “While the price of oil has shot up by $10 since the end of November when many oil producing countries agreed to curb production it appears to have settled around the $55 mark which will be a relief to motorists who no doubt felt forecourt prices were constantly heading in the wrong direction. Filling up an average car is sadly now £11 more expensive than a year ago. The oil production cut, which is the first in eight years, is even more significant because it was brought about by the\xa0Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) making an agreement with 11 other oil producing countries to limit production by a total of 1.8m barrels a day globally with a view to getting the barrel price to increase.  Simon Williams added: “The agreement between OPEC and non-member countries seems to be holding firm for the time being which is not good news for motorists. For prices at the pumps to come down again we would need the oil price to reduce and the pound to make up some of its lost ground on the dollar.  “So a month where fuel prices have stayed broadly the same is welcome news. Given the global oil production situation and the weaker pound all we can really hope for at the moment is some continued price stability on the forecourt.”  Regional fuel price variation The North East took Northern Ireland’s title of having the cheapest fuel in the UK with petrol at an average of 119.34p and diesel at 121.19p at the end of February. The South East remains the most expensive place to buy fuel with a litre of petrol costing 120.94p and diesel 123p. The North West saw the biggest rise in the price of unleaded, albeit only 0.31p and the South East recorded the largest diesel price reduction even though it was just -0.18p.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel rises 2p a litre in January to highest for more than two years&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Feb 03, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;But wholesale cost of fuel stays stable and indicates price cuts are needed Tank of petrol £9.53 more expensive than January 2016 The prices of petrol and diesel at the pumps increased by 2p a litre in January to their highest for more than two years* despite the wholesale cost of unleaded staying the same and diesel reducing, according to the first\xa0RAC Fuel Watch report of 2017**. The pump price rise unfortunately comes hot on the heels of a 3p a litre increase in December, making for a 5p a litre increase since the beginning of December. Aside from a fall in the price of forecourt fuel in November and July last year, the cost of petrol and diesel has been going up steadily since March. A litre of unleaded now stands at 120.01p and diesel at 122.30p – at the start of the year it was 117.90p and 120.35 respectively. At the beginning of August however, the average price paid by motorists for petrol was just 111.17p with diesel only slightly more expensive at 111.93p. And, compared to early January 2016 unleaded has gone up 17p a litre from 102.69p and diesel has increased 21p from its end of January 2016 low of 101.05p. The January pump price increase has added another pound to a tank of petrol or diesel, but sadly filling up a 55-litre family car with unleaded is now £9.53 more expensive and diesel £11.69 dearer than a year ago. However, the RAC believes motorists should be aggrieved by the 2p a litre January jump in price as the wholesale price of unleaded has remained stable throughout the month and diesel has actually reduced slightly.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “In the last two months 5p a litre has been added to the pump price of both petrol and diesel which means the cost of filling up is really starting to hurt motorists again. But the January rise is harder to swallow as there is a saving from wholesale prices that retailers should be passing on a little faster than they are.  “It is particularly worrying that the supermarkets have increased their prices by an average of 3p a litre in January with one adding nearly 5p a litre. “As the wholesale price stands currently we would be expecting to see average prices come down by over a penny a litre in the next fortnight.” The higher pump prices have been driven by a rise in the cost of oil and the lower value of the pound against the dollar. In January the average price of a barrel of oil was just over $54 and sterling exchange rate improved by 3%, helping to ease pump prices slightly as fuel is traded in dollars. Simon Williams added: “The oil production cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries together with non-OPEC countries have definitely led to a higher barrel price which in turn has translated to motorists paying more on the forecourt. But we are hopeful that the oil price will remain around the mid-$50 mark for some time meaning fuel prices should hover around the current level for some time, providing the exchange rate doesn’t worsen. “In the coming weeks we will be using RAC Fuel Watch to monitor prices very carefully with a view to ensuring prices do not rise quicker than they should, and we encourage retailers to pass on any savings should the wholesale price drop. We believe fuel pricing transparency is essential and are doing all we can to make sure that the retail price of petrol and diesel fairly reflect the wholesale cost.” Regional fuel price variation Northern Ireland once again has cheapest fuel in the UK despite suffering the biggest increases in both petrol and diesel in January with nearly 3p a litre being added in the month. The North East saw the smallest increase in unleaded at just under 2p a litre whereas Wales had the lowest diesel rise at just over 1.5p a litre.  The South East is still the most expensive region to buy both petrol or diesel with a litre of unleaded costing an average of 120.94p and diesel 123.26p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel prices rise and are at highest for 18 months&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 05, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;\nPetrol and diesel prices rose by around 3p a litre in December taking them to their highest average prices since July 2015. \nRAC Fuel Watch data for the last month of 2016* shows unleaded hit 117.23p a litre on 29 December and diesel 119.63p having been 114.24p and 116.56p a litre at the beginning of the month. \r\n\tThe wholesale cost of both fuels rose nearly 4p a litre as a result of oil production cuts announced by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries at the end of November. This led to oil rising 11.75% from $49.09 on 30 November to $54.86 on 30 December, with the price going back up through the $50 a barrel mark for the first time since late October. The price of oil is more than double what it was in January 2016 when a low of $26 a barrel was recorded. \r\n\tThe increased cost of fuel meant filling up an average 55-litre family car with petrol rose by £1.60 from £62.83 to £64.48 and for diesel from £64.11 to £65.80. In the course of 2016 unleaded went up 14.5p a litre from 102.99p at the beginning of January and diesel increased 13.64p from 105.99p a litre, although the diesel price went on to reach a low at the end of January of 101.05p, meaning motorists are now paying 18.5p more a litre now. \r\n\tConsequently, it now costs £8 more for a tank of petrol than it did at the same time last year and £10 more for diesel based on the end of January low price of 101.05p a litre. \r\n\tInterestingly, throughout December the average price of a litre of supermarket fuel increased more than it did among all retailers – 3.34p for petrol and 3.16p for diesel compared to 2.99p and 3.07p nationally. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The rising oil price is bad news for motorists as it caused a nasty jump in pump prices in the most expensive month of the year. \r\n\t“While forecourt prices rose by 3p a litre in December as the RAC predicted, they didn’t rocket as others had forecast. The big question now is how much further are they likely to go up, particularly in the long January wait to the next payday. \r\n\t“So far the price rises we’ve seen are purely down to the announcement at the end of November that OPEC and non-OPEC countries would be cutting oil production this month. Everything now depends on the strength of the deal and each country sticking to the agreed production levels. Russia will be of particular interest as it is currently producing at near record levels. \r\n\t“We are optimistic that prices will not increase by another 3p a litre in January based on what’s going on with oil and wholesale fuel now, but if in the months ahead the barrel price was to get nearer to $60 and the pound was to weaken further then that would be the worst possible combination for motorists. \r\n\t“Our current forecast for the next two weeks is for petrol to be around the 118p mark and for diesel to go up to around 121p a litre. We should also say that we need the pound not to lose any more value against the dollar as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars.” \nRegional fuel price variation \r\n\tBy the end of December Northern Ireland was the cheapest place to buy petrol, with the average price of a litre of unleaded selling for 115.58p, but it also saw the smallest increase in price through the month at 1.9p a litre. \r\n\tThe South East remained the most expensive region for both petrol and diesel, with the average litre of unleaded costing 117.84p, and diesel 120.28p, but Scotland saw the biggest jump in the petrol price at 3.75p a litre. Northern Ireland also had the cheapest diesel at 117.88p per litre and the smallest increase in the diesel price at 2.71p a litre. \n\nRegional average unleaded pump prices \n\n \nRegional average diesel pump prices Notes to Editors * The core data for the December 2016\xa0RAC Fuel Watch report is based on an analysis of Experian Catalist average prices from 4 to 29 December 2016.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel prices down in November but rises on the cards&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Petrol and diesel prices fell for the first time in four months in November, the latest data from RAC Fuel Watch shows*, as retailers finally passed on wholesale savings thanks to a lower oil price – but the RAC is warning drivers to expect increases at the pumps before Christmas. The falls were as a result of a mid-month supermarket cut in prices which led to around 2p being taken off the price of both petrol and diesel nationally, and other retailers cut their prices too. By 30 November the average price of unleaded was down 2.89p to 113.96p per litre and diesel was down 2.4p to 116.37p per litre.  Unfortunately, these lower pump prices are likely to be short-lived. Motorists should expect price rises through December as a result of the\xa0cut in oil production announced on the last day of November by OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The market reacted instantly with the price of a physical barrel of Brent crude closing trading up 7% at $49.09 on 30 November and up a further $3.40on the first day of December to $52.49. And, sadly for motorists, this will almost certainly lead to further increases in the coming days and weeks. As things stand, the price of filling up a 55-litre family petrol car is currently at £62.68 (down from £64.27 at the start of November), while a similarly-sized diesel car costs £64 (down from £65.32 on 1 November).  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “While November was a good month for fuel prices with the first reduction for four months, it looks as though motorists are about to have an unwelcome early Christmas present in the form of higher prices at the pump. This is a big change from the last two Decembers when drivers benefited from falling fuel prices. “Given retailers were relatively slow to pass on wholesale price savings to motorists last month, despite the RAC’s calls for a cut, we will be monitoring closely to see if forecourt prices now rocket as a result of the recent leap in the price of oil. “The medium-term outlook for prices is, however, much harder to predict. OPEC has not cut supply for eight years and since mid-2014 has been actively operating an oversupply strategy to keep the barrel price low, to make it unviable for the United States to produce oil from fracking. This week’s production cut appears to be a move away from that and unusually is supported by Russia, which is not a member of OPEC. “What happens to the oil price in the next few weeks as the markets react will be crucial and could set the tone for what happens to prices early into 2017. If the US now responds by increasing its output, prices may not rise as sharply as some are predicting. It is also important to remember that the OPEC cut is currently only in force for six months. “Drivers should remember that while the oil price is the biggest variable affecting fuel prices, it is not the only one. With fuel traded in dollars, the dollar/sterling exchange rate also has a bearing on what retailers pay, and in turn what we pay when we fill up. A weaker pound, as we have seen since the EU vote, can see forecourt prices rise but a stronger pound can do the reverse. The unprecedented political situation on both sides of the Atlantic has the potential to buffet the exchange rate significantly through next year. “With the Chancellor rightly choosing to extend the freeze on fuel duty in last month’s Autumn Statement, with the rate remaining at 57.95p per litre, at least motorists won’t be hit with extra tax on fuel next year.”  Regional fuel price variation Wales was not only the cheapest place to buy petrol at the end of November, with the average price of a litre of unleaded selling for 113.12p, but it also enjoyed the biggest fall in price through the month (down 3.58p). The South East remained the most expensive region for both petrol and diesel, with the average litre of unleaded costing 114.56p, and diesel 116.88p. Northern Ireland was selling the cheapest diesel at 115.3p per litre, but it was East Anglia that recorded the sharpest drop in diesel prices, down 2.7p to 116.61p per litre.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;RAC calls for urgent pump price cut as wholesale costs fall&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Nov 11, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The RAC is calling on fuel retailers to cut prices at the pumps to reflect the falling wholesale prices of unleaded and diesel that have been triggered by a falling oil price and steadying pound. On 9 November 2016,\xa0RAC Fuel Watch data shows the average price of a litre of unleaded in the UK stood at 116.76p, with diesel at 118.64p. With wholesale prices down by around 4p in the last two and half weeks (25 October), the RAC believes there is now scope for a forecourt price cut of at least 3p per litre off both fuels, which would bring average petrol and diesel prices down to under 114p and 116p respectively.   The fall in wholesale prices means that the most price-competitive retailers including supermarkets and some independents could be selling petrol for around 110p a litre and diesel for 112.5p. Despite wholesale prices having been falling since 25 October the average price of both petrol and diesel have actually very slightly increased, by around a third of a penny. The ‘flash crash’ of the pound that occurred at the start of October, coupled with the oil price that rose through much of the month, has been pushing the price of petrol and diesel up. In fact,\xa0petrol rose more in October than in any month in the past three and a half years. But the more recent fall in the cost of oil and a slight recovery in the value of the pound is cancelling out some of October’s rises. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Fears are looming that OPEC’s planned production cut, due to be agreed at the end of November, won’t come to fruition and consequently won’t stem the over-production of oil that has kept prices low. The effect of that has been a short, sharp fall in the oil price, down from more than $50 a fortnight ago to around $43 now. This, combined with a rallying pound following last week’s High Court case on Brexit and the result of the US election, is causing wholesale prices to fall – which should be good news for motorists. “Consequently, we are now looking to retailers to cut their forecourt prices and save drivers money when they next fill up. We are very surprised retailers haven’t reduced their forecourt prices in the last week as they have a good recent record of passing on wholesale price savings at the pump. However, this current unwillingness to cut will not help their cause in getting motorists to believe that forecourt prices don’t go up like a rocket when wholesale prices rise and fall like a feather when they’re coming down. “A logical conclusion is that retailers are taking advantage of the current climate which has led people to think that higher fuel prices are an inevitability simply because of the weaker pound and talk of the rising cost of goods. A petrol and diesel cut by retailers now will send the right message to consumers that they can still benefit when wholesale fuel prices fall as they have done in recent days.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting\xa0rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;October sees biggest petrol price rise at UK forecourts in three and a half years&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Nov 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Unleaded prices now at highest since July 2015 Weak pound and a higher oil price biggest factors contributing to rise RAC calls for continued fuel duty freeze amid price uncertainty  The price of petrol rose more in October than at any time since February 2013, with diesel rising at the fastest rate since May 2008, data from the RAC’s latest Fuel Watch report shows.* A combination of a weak pound and Brexit fears since the UK’s EU referendum vote and rising oil prices have contributed to average petrol prices rising by 4.39p per litre from 112.34p on 2 October to 116.73p on 31 October. Diesel was up 5.17p per litre, ending the month at 118.65p on average, having begun the month at 113.48p. The average price of both fuels at the forecourt are now at their highest levels since July 2015 – 116.73p per litre for petrol and 118.65p for diesel.  But there are indications that pump prices might stabilise or even reduce slightly in November, as the cost of oil started to fall back in the last days of October. A barrel of Brent crude averaged just under $50 through the month but ended October at a one-month low of $46.63, down from its peak of $51.63 on Wednesday 19 October. Wholesale prices have also responded by dropping sharply at the very end of the month, down by almost 1p and 2p a litre for petrol and diesel respectively. It now costs £64.20 to fill an average-sized 55-litre petrol family car, with a similar diesel car costing £65.25 per tank to fill. For a light commercial diesel vehicle with an 80-litre tank, it now costs £94.92 to fill from empty. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “October 2016 was an historic month for UK pump prices but – sadly for motorists – for all the wrong reasons. The effects of the weak pound have really been felt on the wholesale market, and this, combined with an oil price at nearly double its lowest level in 2016, has put significant upward pressure on wholesale fuel prices. Retailers have had no choice but to reflect these dramatic increases in the prices they charge at the pumps. “Certainly, we are a long way from the remarkably low fuel prices enjoyed by families and businesses early in 2016, when the average price of unleaded was around 102p per litre and diesel was 101p. But while the pound remains in the doldrums, and with few expecting it to recover in the near future, there are some indications that November might not shape up so badly. “The biggest variable affecting what drivers pay when they fill up is the oil price. OPEC, which represents some of the world’s biggest oil producers, recently agreed in principle a cut in production. This would mark a move away from the over-production strategy that they have employed for so long, and mere talk of a cut has been enough to force oil prices higher. But a final deal is still to be agreed at an OPEC meeting at the end of this month and, with some analysts suggesting a deal might yet stall, this leaves open the prospect oil prices might stabilise or even fall before the end of the year.  “Certainly, if the Chancellor has been considering tinkering with fuel duty in this month’s Autumn Statement, the sheer volatility of prices we are currently seeing should, we hope, be enough to make him reconsider.” Regional fuel price variation The South East of England remains the most expensive place to buy petrol in the UK, with the average price standing at 117.18p per litre, while the East Anglia remains the most expensive region for diesel with the average litre on sale for 119.13p. Northern Ireland still sells the UK’s cheapest fuel, with the average price of unleaded at 115.45p per litre and diesel at 117.25p. However, Northern Ireland saw the sharpest rise in the price of unleaded in October (up 5.16p). Scotland saw the largest increase in the price of diesel, up 5.71p.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel prices edge up in August despite early supermarket cut&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Sep 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The average price of both petrol and diesel sold on Britain’s forecourts edged up in August, despite a price cut at the start of the month, the latest data from RAC Fuel Watch indicates.* A litre of unleaded was sold for an average of 111.5p at the end of August, up 0.33p on the price at the start of the month. The average price of diesel meanwhile rose 0.77p, finishing the month not far off a 2016 high at 112.81p. While only slight increases, the effect cancelled out the fall in the average price of both fuels that took place in July. Following calls by the RAC for a cut in fuel prices to reflect softening wholesale prices, supermarkets took 2p off the price of a litre of both petrol and diesel on 1 August, forcing down average forecourt prices during the first week of the month. But since then average prices have started to creep back up – rising again by nearly 2p per litre from the end of the second week of the month. The increase in prices has been triggered by the rising price of a physical barrel of oil, up $6 (or 15%) in August and ending the month at $46.28, albeit down from the mid-month high of $49.78. The oil price is currently the biggest variable impacting fuel prices and the August increase contributed to a 3.11p rise in wholesale petrol prices and 4.81p rise in wholesale diesel prices. The average cost of filling up a family car with a 55 litre tank now stands at £61.33 for unleaded, and £62.05 for diesel. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “There was a strong case for a 3p per litre cut in the price of petrol and diesel in late July, and it was a relief to see retailers going some way towards passing on savings to motorists at the start of August. Since this point however, the oil price has rebounded slightly which has had the effect of pushing up wholesale fuel prices again. “Motorists have benefited from some slightly cheaper fuel prices in August compared to July, which will have come at a helpful time given the school holidays. “It is still the case however that the average price of unleaded petrol grew at its slowest rate in more than a year in August, and we are thankfully still a little way off the sorts of average prices we saw earlier in 2015 when petrol hit 117p per litre and diesel nearly 121p per litre. “There has been much speculation that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) might agree a curb on oil output, together with some non-OPEC members such as Russia, which could lead to price rises. But there has been this sort of speculation before and to date, no caps on production have been agreed and supply is still outpacing demand meaning the oil price has remained relatively low. It remains to be seen if, following a planned meeting in Algeria in late September, anything concrete is agreed which may give us a clearer idea of where oil prices, and therefore fuel prices, might be heading into the end of the year.” Regional fuel price variation The north of England saw the largest average petrol price rises in August, with a litre of petrol up 0.57p to 111.18p, while the sharpest diesel price rises were in Yorkshire and Humber (up 0.97p to 112.35p).  Northern Ireland was the only part of the UK that recorded a fall in average fuel prices in August, with a litre of unleaded down just 0.05p to 110.61p. The country also enjoys the lowest prices for both petrol (110.61p) and diesel (111.69p). The South East remains the most expensive region for fuel, with a litre of unleaded on average selling for 111.93p and diesel at 113.22p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;July brings an end to four months of rising fuel prices&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Aug 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;After four consecutive months of pump price rises, the average cost of petrol on Britain’s forecourts* has started to fall again, data from the RAC’s July Fuel Watch report shows. While the reduction in the price of unleaded is only small – 0.41p from 112.20p to 111.79p – it reverses the rising price trend which began in March. The average price of diesel also fell, but even more slightly (0.06p) from 112.47p to 112.41p. The fall in pump prices has been brought about by a reduction in the wholesale cost of both petrol and diesel. The price retailers pay for unleaded fell by 4.41p a litre and diesel by 4.67p in July, caused primarily by a $6.44 – or 11% – fall in the price of a physical barrel of oil, down from $48.07 on 1 July to $41.63 on 29 July.  What’s more, this reduction in the price of oil has meant the devaluation of sterling following the UK’s Brexit vote, which some had feared would lead to a price hike as fuel is traded in dollars, did not impact wholesale fuel costs negatively. Throughout July the value of the pound maintained an average of $1.31 against the dollar. The dramatic drop in the cost of wholesale fuel led the RAC to make a public plea to retailers on Thursday 28 July to cut their prices. On Monday 1 August this was acted upon by the major supermarkets, which together are responsible for selling around 40% of the UK’s fuel, with many knocking 2p a litre off both petrol and diesel prices.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “July’s slight reduction in fuel prices is very welcome as it has ended four months of rising prices on the forecourt. We are hopeful that the early August supermarket cut will make a bigger difference to household budgets in the summer holiday period even though it came a more than a week later than it should have done. “The falling price of fuel on the wholesale market is being driven by fears of slowing global economic growth adding to an existing oversupply of both crude oil and refined products such as petrol and diesel. Interestingly, this has happened at time when there are oil supply disruptions in Nigeria and Libya which had they not occurred would have meant there was even more oil on the world market. “As it is motorists continue to benefit from the lower oil price which had led to petrol prices that are nearly 5p a litre cheaper than a year ago and diesel that’s more than 3p a litre less expensive.” UK fuel price variation Across the UK, the East Midlands saw the biggest drop in average prices of both petrol and diesel; unleaded came down 1.53p a litre and diesel 0.95p. Northern Ireland’s petrol prices reduced the least, but its unleaded is still some of the cheapest in the UK, only more expensive than Yorkshire and Humber (110.54p v 110.37p).  Both Scotland and Northern Ireland unfortunately suffered very slight rises in the price of diesel (0.13p and 016p). Despite this Northern Ireland’s diesel is still the cheapest in the UK; Scotland’s however is among the most expensive. The South East remains the dearest place to buy fuel with average petrol prices in the region at 111.70p and diesel at 112.49p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;RAC issues plea for immediate pump price cuts&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jul 28, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The RAC is today issuing a plea to fuel retailers to play fair with UK motorists by immediately cutting the price of both unleaded and diesel at the pumps, in the wake of falling oil and wholesale fuel prices. The oil price, currently the biggest factor determining UK fuel prices besides fuel duty, is now at its lowest level since early May – around $43 a barrel. As a result, wholesale costs including VAT – the price retailers buy fuel for – have been falling for nearly a month and currently stand at 103.65p for petrol and 104.32p for diesel. Despite this, pump prices have remained largely static during this time, at around 112p on average per litre and with some motorway services charging as much as 127p per litre. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “There is now a compelling case for an immediate price cut of 3p per litre off the price of both petrol and diesel at forecourts. That would take average prices down to around 109p per litre, and would see some of the most competitive retailers selling unleaded and diesel around 106p. “We would hope that retailers are not taking advantage of public perceptions that fuel prices would rise following the Brexit vote last month, as the wholesale market is clearly showing a downward trend in prices right now. Retailers have a reasonable recent record of passing cost savings on, and we would like to think the fact they have not yet done\xa0this is a blip rather than a new norm. “Another dip in the already low world oil price – driven by oversupply and concerns about the global economic outlook – is putting a lot of downward pressure on wholesale prices, and we believe retailers should now act by passing on the savings they are making to the UK’s motorists. “With millions of families currently away on holiday or soon to leave, combined with a boom in staycations this year, a cut now would be widely welcomed and would give motorists confidence that retailers are not keeping prices artificially high.”  Fuel prices have continued to rise since last winter when average unleaded prices hit a low of 101.27p per litre.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;RAC calls on fuel retailers to pass on wholesale unleaded price savings&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jul 13, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;2p cut expected off the price of unleaded; possible diesel cuts to follow The RAC is urging retailers to cut the forecourt price of petrol to reflect the falling price of unleaded fuel on the wholesale market. The price of oil is currently the biggest factor affecting the price UK drivers pay at the pumps, and a barrel of Brent crude oil ended both Monday and last Friday under $45 – the first time it has dropped to this point since early May. The falling oil price has had the effect of pushing down wholesale fuel prices, and to a large extent has cancelled out the impact of the declining value of sterling, RAC Fuel Watch data shows. Since the day it was announced Britain had voted to leave the European Union on 24 June, the wholesale price of unleaded including VAT has fallen 2.84p to 104.65p, yet the average price on forecourts has risen by 0.54p to 112.29p. The diesel price meanwhile has remained largely static, falling just 0.26p on wholesale markets to 106.42p, and rising 0.73p to 112.72p at the pumps. RAC spokesman Pete Williams said: “Despite some fears that petrol prices could shoot up as a result of the EU referendum, we believe there is now a strong case for a cut in the price of unleaded on UK forecourts. “The fact remains that the headline oil pricehas a huge bearing on what we pay for fuel at the pumps, and it is this price that has been falling as a result of relatively weak global demand and new fears of oil oversupply. “At a time when both consumer spending and the strength of the UK’s economy are under intense scrutiny in the wake of the EU referendum result, transparency in fuel pricing is crucial and we are therefore calling on retailers to do the right thing and pass on wholesale savings to drivers. “Two-thirds of cars on our roads run on petrol and a cut now ahead of the school holidays in less than a fortnight would be a welcome boost to families’ pockets. “We are also continuing to monitor the price of diesel closely to see if there is scope for a price cut in the weeks ahead.” A cut of 2p in the price of unleaded petrol would take the average price of a litre down to around 110p, or less than 108p per litre at the cheapest forecourts. Fuel prices have been increasing since the last winter when the average price for a litre of petrol hit a low of 101.27p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Motorists hit by fourth straight month of fuel price rises&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jul 05, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;The average prices of petrol and\xa0diesel have increased for the fourth month running, according to\xa0RAC Fuel Watch\xa0data for June, but wholesale fuel prices have only risen very slightly as a result of the pound weakening after the UK voted to leave the EU. Unleaded went up 1.5p a litre (110.69p to 112.17p) and diesel by 1.66p (110.73p to 112.39p) in a month which saw oil rise from $48 to an early high of $50.73 and then fall to a mid-month low of $45.95 before finishing June on $48 again, coupled, of course, with the pound hitting a 31-year low against the dollar.  The impact of the 11% post-referendum fall in the value of the pound was softened by a simultaneous 6% drop in the oil price, meaning wholesale prices were largely unaffected. The pound ended the month 7% weaker – $1.43 to $1.34.  The forecourt price rise, which has seen unleaded go up more than 10p a litre from 101.91p at the start of March to 112.17p at the end of June, means the cost of filling an average petrol family car has increased by £5.64 to £61.69 in four months. The June pump price rise added 81p (£60.88 to £61.69) to the cost of a tank of petrol and 91p (£60.90 to £61.81) to a complete diesel fill-up. Diesel is now nearly 11p more expensive than at the beginning of March (101.56p to 112.39p), making a tank £5.96 dearer. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;June was another bad month for motorists with the price of petrol going up again. While it was only a penny and a half it makes for a rise of more than 10p since the start of March. Filling up with unleaded is now £5.64 more expensive which is enough to make an unpleasant dent in household budgets up and down the country, especially for those who have more than one car or need to fill up regularly. “But it is good news that fuel prices are so far weathering the Brexit storm; wholesale prices have remained relatively stable after an initial small upward jolt as a result of the pound falling on news of the referendum result. The fact the oil price dropped at the same time lessened the negative effect of the pound’s devaluation. We may well see pump prices rise slightly in July, but current indications are that this is unlikely to be the shock rise some were predicting. “The lower cost of a barrel of oil plays the greatest part in keeping forecourt prices down. It’s also worth remembering that compared to a year ago we are still paying around 5p less for petrol and nearly 8.5p less for diesel.  “While economists are saying the pound is unlikely to recover the ground it lost against the dollar so dramatically the day after the referendum, the oil price looks likely to stay around the $50 mark for some time due to OPEC’s continued over production strategy. There is also a hope that prices might even fall once various issues that have hindered production around the world are resolved.”   UK fuel price variation Across the UK, the South West and East Anglia saw the largest rises in average petrol prices at 1.7p a litre, while Scotland underwent the biggest diesel price increase at 1.76p. Scotland’s fortunes with unleaded though were far better, undergoing the smallest increase in the UK at just 1.23p a litre. The East Midlands saw the smallest diesel increase at 1.48p. Northern Ireland was still the cheapest place to buy both petrol and diesel in the UK with petrol at 110.99p and diesel at 110.64p. And, the South East kept its title of being the most expensive place to buy fuel with unleaded at an average of 112.70p and diesel at 113.05p.

Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;May sees price of petrol and diesel increase for third month in a row&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jun 04, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;Tank of petrol now £4.77 more expensive than at the end of February Price of oil rises by 14% adding another $6 to a barrel in May   The average prices of petrol and diesel have increased for the third month in a row making filling up an average family car around £5 more expensive than it was at the end of February. RAC Fuel Watch data for May reveals that the average unleaded pump price rose 2p a litre (1.92p) from 108.67p a litre to 110.59p, adding £1 to the cost of filling up a 55-litre family car in the course of the month (£59.77 to £60.82). This means that since the end of February the cost of a tank of petrol has risen by £4.77 (101.91p – £56.05 v 110.59p – £60.82). The average diesel forecourt price saw an even greater increase, going up by 2.2p a litre from 108.49p to 110.70p. This made the cost of a full tank of diesel £1.22 more expensive (£59.67 to £60.89), and a whopping £5.14 dearer than at the end of February\xa0(101.36p – £55.75 v 110.70p – £60.89). Average supermarket prices of petrol and diesel increased by 2% – 1.85p a litre for petrol (106.08p to 107.93p) and 1.68p for diesel (105.91p to 107.59p). Wholesale prices of both fuels have also gone up; petrol by 3.2p a litre and diesel by 4p a litre, predominantly as a result of the oil price continuing to rise. The spot – or physical – price of oil, so important in the wholesale fuel price, rose 14% in May, adding $6 to a barrel ($43.18 on 3 May to $49.26 on 31 May), and a barrel also reached its highest price since mid-October 2015 when it finished trading at $49.53 on Thursday 26 May.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;Motorists will be disappointed to see pump prices going up again having enjoyed filling up their vehicles with petrol and diesel for under £1 a litre at the start of the year. The sub-£1 litre is now sadly starting to seem like a distant memory. “Since the end of February the price of both unleaded and diesel have increased by around 9p a litre which has driven the cost of filling up by around £5. Now summer’s here what most families want is a period of stability so that making the most of the better weather doesn’t lose some of its shine through higher costs at the pump. “Much depends on the physical price of oil not rising any further. The oil price teetered around the $50 a barrel mark for the last few days of May having risen due to the extra demand from the start of the US summer driving season, but it has yet to go higher. Fortunately, some of the refinery issues which had led to lower than expected output have been resolved and we now have increased crude production in the Middle East. &quot;And, with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries deciding not to curtail production at its six-monthly meeting in Vienna on Thursday, there is good reason to expect the oil price will not go far above the current level for the time being, but predicting what will happen with oil is far from straightforward.” UK fuel price variation Across the UK, East Anglia saw the biggest increase in petrol prices with a 2.18p a litre rise, while the South East experienced the greatest diesel price hike at 2.31p. The North West underwent the smallest increases in both petrol and diesel, while Northern Ireland remains the cheapest place to buy fuel in the UK with petrol at 109.64p and diesel at 109p. The South East meanwhile has the most expensive fuel with unleaded at an average of 110.97p and diesel at 111.37p.

Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of petrol increases for second month in a row adding £1.45 to a fill-up&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;May 05, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;\r\n\tRAC Fuel Watch data for April shows motorists have suffered the second consecutive month of price rises at the pumps as a result of a 25% increase in the cost of a barrel of oil from $36.51 to $45.49 (1 &amp; 29 April), leading to the highest price since 10 November 2015 – $45.62 on 28 April. \r\n\tThe escalating oil price is the primary reason behind the forecourt increases with the average price of both petrol and diesel going up by more than 2p a litre to 108.27p (from 105.64p) and 108p (from 105.41p) respectively. The wholesale cost of petrol rose 2.5p whereas diesel increased by 4.6p a litre. \r\n\tThe petrol price rise has added another £1.45 to the cost of filling up a 55-litre family car (£58.10 to £59.55) on top of the £1.84 increased cost seen in March, making for a combined increase of £3.29p since 1 March. The cost of a tank of diesel rose by a similar amount in April – £1.42 (£57.98 to £59.40) on top of the £2 increase seen in March – making a two-month jump of £3.42 for a fill-up. \r\n\tSupermarket average prices rose by 3p a litre for both fuels with petrol rising from 102.68p per litre to 105.85p and diesel from 102.58p to 105.76p. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;The physical or spot price of Brent crude oil saw its largest one-month gain in price in the past 12 months. While this has had an adverse impact on the price motorists are paying for petrol and diesel on the forecourt, the world is still producing too much oil which means prices should not rise much further, and may stabilise or even start to fall again. \r\n\t“It’s worth remembering that while prices have gone up in both March and April motorists are still paying 7p per litre less for petrol and 11p per litre less for diesel than they were at this time a year ago which means a tank of unleaded is more than £3 cheaper and diesel is £6 less expensive. \r\n\t“The world oil market is currently in a very unusual situation. For some time\xa0OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – has been operating an overproduction strategy to keep prices low to stop the US producing oil from fracking, but April saw reduced production from Iraq and Nigeria due to supply disruptions and from the United Arab Emirates due to maintenance, which alongside a US fall in production, appears to have led to the oil price going up. \r\n\t“But, if the barrel price reaches $50 drilling would become a profitable option again for US shale producers and OPEC’s long-term efforts to maintain its market share would be undermined. For this reason it seems unlikely that the oil price will increase too much more.” \nUK fuel price variation \r\n\tAcross the UK, the South East saw the biggest increases with more than 3p a litre going on both the average prices of petrol and diesel – unleaded went from 105.48p to 108.89p and diesel from 105.52p to 108.9p. The East Midlands recorded the lowest petrol price rise of 2.77p a litre from 105.4p to 108.17p whereas the price of diesel in Northern Ireland was the lowest, only rising by 2.63p a litre from 104.02p to 106.65p. \n* Regional prices based on 31 March to 2 May 2016.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of petrol goes up 3p a litre in March signalling first rise since July 2015&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Apr 05, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;After eight months of falling pump prices RAC Fuel Watch data* reveals the average price of petrol suffered a sudden and unwelcome 3p a litre rise in March as oil went back above $40 a barrel for the first time since 4 December last year. The cost of a barrel of oil increased 8% from $35.91 on 3 March to $38.70 at month end causing the first upward shift in forecourt petrol prices since July 2015. At the start of March the average price of a litre of petrol was 101.91p but by the close it was 105.26p – an increase of more than 3p – which added £1.84 to the cost of filling up an average 55-litre car – £57.89. The wholesale price of petrol, including VAT, increased 6p a litre from 97.13p to 103.19p, suggesting that the pump price is likely to go up again in the coming weeks. Supermarket fuel prices, which are traditionally the lowest in the country, also went up. At the start of March, the average supermarket price of a litre of petrol was 99.88p but by month end a litre cost 102.19p – a rise of more than 2p. Worryingly, RAC Fuel Watch data for March shows diesel forecourt prices also increased by 3.7p a litre – 101.56p to 105.26p – even though the wholesale price only rose by 1.5p a litre (98.12p to 99.59p), adding £2 to the cost of a 55-litre tank. This indicates that retailers are once again either using the lower diesel wholesale cost to subsidise the price of petrol or using it as a means of increasing their profit margin. At supermarkets the average price of diesel rose equally dramatically – 3.5p a litre – from 98.57p to 102.09p.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;The good times for motorists enjoying lower fuel prices had to come to an end at some point, but unfortunately it’s happened with a bit more of a bump than motorists were probably expecting. With an important oil production meeting scheduled for mid-April, more bad news at the pumps may be on the horizon.” The price of a barrel of oil went up significantly in March, going over the $40-mark for four days in the middle of the month before dropping back to $38 by month end. While the world is still producing far more oil than it needs, a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to discuss limiting output is due to take place in Qatar on 17 April.  Simon Williams added: “An earlier meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC countries responsible for nearly 75% of the world’s oil production led to output being restricted to January levels. While this helped to revive oil prices, producers clearly still feel a further limit on production is needed. This is bad news for motorists as it will inevitably lead to more price rises on the forecourt. “We hope the rebound in pump prices will be limited by the fact that OPEC will not want to let the price go too far back up. Otherwise all their work aimed at safeguarding their market share will be undermined by oil production from fracking in the US being stepped back up again if oil goes back above $60 a barrel – the recognised point at which fracking becomes financially viable. For this reason, it looks as though we are heading towards a new norm of the oil price fluctuating between lower and upper limits of $35 and $55 a barrel.  “This means that motorists should hopefully not see the eye-watering prices they were paying at the pumps in April 2012 when the average price of petrol was 142p and diesel was close to 150p per litre. Motorists will also be relieved that the Chancellor saw sense and listened to the RAC and other campaigning groups by extending the freeze on fuel duty in his Budget.”   UK fuel price variation Around the UK, Wales saw the biggest increase in average petrol prices – 3.7p – from 101.4p to 105.1p. Average diesel prices went up most in East Anglia – 3.88p – from 101.49p to 105.37p.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;February sees price of petrol fall for eighth straight month&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Mar 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Average price of diesel remains static after January’s 5p fall The average price of petrol fell slightly in February, marking eight consecutive months of falls, RAC Fuel Watch data reveals. Motorists have now enjoyed eight months of falling unleaded prices from the beginning of July 2015 when the average price of a litre was 117p. At the end of February, the average price of petrol at forecourts was 101.93p – a drop of 15p and a saving of £8.25 on filling up an average 55-litre family car. February saw a small fall of 0.16p in the price of unleaded at the pumps. The wholesale price of petrol also finished the month 2p a litre cheaper than at the start due to increased petrol production, which should help to keep pump prices at their current level in the short term, or possibly even reduce them very slightly in March. The RAC Fuel Watch February report also shows that the price of diesel at the pumps remains largely static, rising from 101.11p to 101.18p, despite a 2.5p rise in its wholesale price. While this is a turnaround from January which saw a 5p reduction, the average price of diesel is still nearly a penny cheaper than that of petrol (diesel – 101.18p v petrol 101.93p). The average forecourt price of diesel has been lower than petrol since 25 January 2016 but is likely to switch back again in March. Average supermarket prices of both petrol and diesel hardly changed in February: petrol started the month at 99.88p and finished at 99.86p whereas diesel rose marginally: 97.96p to 98.24p. Both the oil price and the exchange rate – the two factors which have the greatest effect on fuel prices aside from tax – were the subject of much attention in February. The pound lost ground against the dollar throughout the month, falling from $1.44 on 1 February to $1.39 by the end, while oil underwent a late price surge to finish at $35.80 having started the month at $32.75.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Forecourt prices of both petrol and diesel have remained remarkably stable in February despite the pound losing 3% of its value against the dollar and talk of an oil production cut. The oil price had been consistently around $30 for most of the month but in the last few days of February rose to around $36 – a price we haven’t seen since the beginning of the year.  “Motorists are still benefiting from low prices at the pumps, with the supermarkets having held their petrol prices under £1 a litre thanks to a depressed wholesale price. In fact the wholesale price of petrol has fallen due to refineries scaling down heating oil production and switching instead to producing more unleaded, together with the US refining more petrol as it gears up for the American driving season which starts in May. This tends to have the temporary short-term effect of reducing the wholesale price, but this may change as demand for petrol picks up in the States. “While the average pump price of diesel has been cheaper than petrol since the end of January (25 January 2016) this may not last much longer due the increase in petrol production and its lower wholesale price. But the additional supply of diesel on the wholesale market brought about by greater refinery capacity in Saudi Arabia and India should mean prices remain comparatively stable for diesel motorists at the pump. “If it proves to be the case that oil prices have bottomed out, the RAC will be monitoring the effect on pump prices even more closely for any sign of the infamous ‘rocket and feather effect’ where prices go up far faster than they came down.” Is a fuel duty rise looming on the horizon? Simon Williams added: “Putting the oil price and the exchange rate to one side, motorists will be concerned as to whether the Chancellor decides to tinker with fuel duty in the upcoming Budget on 16 March. Throughout the last parliament he chose to maintain an even keel by freezing duty at 57.95p a litre after his penny a litre cut in the 2011 Budget, but we fear he may now seek to take advantage of low oil prices to increase it.  “Both independent modelling and the Treasury’s own analysis have demonstrated that an increase in fuel duty has a negative impact on economic growth and therefore we vehemently oppose any rise in fuel duty because the country would the pay the price for this in the longer term. “Motorists will be unforgiving of the Chancellor should he seek to squeeze more tax out of them when they are already amongst the highest taxed on fuel in Europe.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

This is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of fuel may have reached low point for now, warns the RAC&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Feb 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Motorists should make the most of petrol being under £1 while it lasts as data from the RAC Fuel Watch January report suggests the cheap fuel market may have bottomed out. Since oil reached a 12-year low of $26 on Wednesday 20 January ($25.73 – 27 August 2003) the barrel price has rebounded, finishing the month at $33.12, only $3 below where it started at $36.54. This has caused the wholesale cost of both petrol and diesel to rise again, although diesel still remains 3p a litre cheaper than unleaded. January was nonetheless a landmark month for diesel with 5p a litre coming off the average pump price as a result of the supermarkets first cutting to 99.9p a litre and later to below 98p. This led to an average petrol-diesel price flip on Monday 25 January with diesel becoming cheaper than unleaded (101.18p diesel v 101.86p petrol) – the second time in six months, the previous time being 29 July 2015 which lasted for nearly two months.  At the start of the year an average litre of diesel cost UK motorists 105.99p, but by the close of January this had fallen to 101.05p; in contrast petrol only fell from 102.69p to 102.01p, albeit its seventh consecutive monthly drop. As a result of the average 5p a litre diesel price reduction, the cost of filling a 55-litre family car came down by £2.72 to £55.58. While this impressive monthly reduction is causing the average price of diesel to move ever closer to the £1 milestone, early signs of an oil price recovery may prevent this happening.  At the end of November, the RAC signalled that drops in the wholesale price of diesel suggested an opportunity for a significant drop in retail diesel prices and supermarkets reacted particularly positively to the situation and dropped their average prices by 6.5p from 104.41p at the start of the month to 97.96p by the close. There was no change with supermarket unleaded prices – staying at an average of 99.87p throughout January. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Motorists have seen petrol and diesel prices reach their lowest points since 2009. January saw the oil price go into free fall with talk of a barrel dropping to $20 and possibly even to $10, but since the low of $26 a barrel the market has started to creep back up. If this continues for a sustained period, wholesale costs will rise further which will in turn lead to pump price increases. “However, the oil market is notoriously volatile, even in more stable economic times, so it’s still possible that the price could drop back again. And, even if there is a rise in the oil price, it seems unlikely that it will be drastic as OPEC seems set to continue producing more oil than is demanded to retain its market share. While there has been talk of a production cut, the market has yet to see evidence of this. “The other factor which is not helping the situation from a motorist’s perspective is the fact that the pound has weakened significantly against the dollar from $1.47 at the beginning of January to $1.42 by the end. This has undermined some of the benefit of the falling oil price and, with oil traded in dollars, this could prove to be even more harmful if the pound continues to lose value against the dollar while the oil price goes up.” HM Revenue and Customs data for December 2015 shows combined sales of petrol and diesel were 1.8% down on November at 3.938bn litres but 0.4% up on December 2014. More petrol was used in December 2015 than in the previous month – 1.458bn litres compared to 1.437bn; this was also a 0.8% increase on December 2014. Diesel usage, however, fell month on month by 3.7% from 2.574bn litres in November to 2.480bn in December, but was unchanged year on year. Sales of both petrol and diesel in December netted the Treasury £2.282bn in fuel duty revenue.

This is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel prices may go as low as 86p a litre if oil price continues to fall&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 14, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Price of a litre of fuel may become cheaper than some bottled waterBut thousands still missing out on cheaper prices depending where they live The freefalling price of a barrel oil may lead to forecourt petrol and diesel prices going as low as 86p a litre at the cheapest fuel retail sites, the RAC says – but warns thousands of motorists are still missing out on cheaper prices. If a barrel of oil falls to $20, pump prices should come down to around 90p a litre at supermarkets and other cheap fuel forecourts, but a further fall to the $10 mark,\xa0as some analysts are now predicting, could pave the way for petrol and diesel to reach as low as 86p a litre. This would, however, depend on the pound not weakening further against the dollar. Since the beginning of December oil has tumbled by 30% from $43.26 to a 12-year low of $30.06 on Monday 11 January, but unfortunately wholesale fuel prices have not reduced as much as they could have due to the pound weakening against the dollar by 4.5% over the same period.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “With no apparent end in sight to the freefalling price of oil, motorists can expect some really low fuel prices in 2016. Breaking through the pound a litre price point for both petrol and diesel was clearly a welcome landmark, but it looks as though there is more to come. In fact we may get to a bizarre time when a litre of fuel is cheaper than a litre of some bottled waters. “At the moment, however, we have a situation where retailers still need to pass on more wholesale price savings on diesel to motorists at the pump, as the wholesale price is still 3p a litre cheaper than that of petrol. We should really be seeing diesel priced several pence cheaper than petrol on every forecourt, to the point where the average price of diesel goes below that of petrol. In many areas of the UK the price of fuel is sadly far higher than it should be: we would urge every fuel retailer to price fuel on their forecourts so that it more fairly reflects wholesale prices. “There is, however, a limit to how low prices can go as tax – fuel duty at 57.95p a litre and VAT on the total price, including fuel duty – make up the lion’s share of the price of a litre. Even if the fuel was given away and the retailers didn’t take a margin, the price of a litre would still be 70p.  “Every motorist should know that the tax-take at £1 a litre is 75%, and at 86p a litre it rises to a staggering 84%. Strangely, this means that VAT alone would be 14p, which would be more than the cost of the fuel and the retailer’s margin. Sadly,\xa0the Chancellor looks likely to put duty up in the Budget in March for the first time since January 2011. We would urge him not to use lower fuel prices as an opportunity to extract even more tax from the motorist at the pumps.” Currently,\xa0the average price of petrol is 102.5p and diesel is 103.21p: a reflection of the sub-£1 a litre fuel on supermarket forecourts as well as many other price-competitive retailers. However, RAC Fuel Watch data – which monitors the same information that retailers use – shows there is scope for a 5p reduction in the average forecourt price of diesel. Simon Williams added: “Unfortunately, even though our Fuel Watch data predicts a large reduction in average diesel pump prices experience from the last month tells us that retailers are simply not passing on as much of the savings at the forecourt as they should. They have been using the savings in the wholesale cost of diesel to subsidise petrol prices, but for the sake of transparent fuel retailing, this needs to change and motorists should see another cut in the price of diesel. “If retailers were to reduce the diesel price in line with the wholesale cost we should see the average price get very close to the £1 mark. “We are concerned that too few drivers are benefitting from these incredibly low oil prices as many less competitive retailers are still selling fuel at far nearer to £1.10 a litre than £1.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of petrol falls for sixth month in a row with the gift of sub-£1 a litre&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 06, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Average price of unleaded falls by 4p a litre in December saving £2 a fill-up Diesel reduces 3p a litre saving motorists £2.56 a tank Price of oil falls 17% prompting retail price cutting The average price of petrol fell by more than 4p a litre in December – from 107.55p at the start to 102.89p by the close, reducing the cost of filling up a family-sized 55-litre car for the sixth consecutive month – a saving of £2.02 on every tank. In the month where drivers were once again treated to the widespread sight of petrol being sold for under £1 a litre, RAC Fuel Watch data for December shows the month-end unleaded average price of 102.89p was the lowest since December 2009 and led to a tank of petrol costing £5.35 less than at the end of 2014.  The average price of diesel also dropped 3p a litre during the month – from 109.86p to 106.18p – cutting the cost of filling a typical tank by £2.56 and making it £6.91 cheaper than at the end of December 2014. The falling price of diesel may also have contributed to a new record sales high with Government statistics for November showing the UK used 2.574bn litres of diesel, which is more than at any point since 1990.   RAC Fuel Watch – which monitors the same data that retailers use – reports that December saw drops in the wholesale price of both petrol and diesel of 2% and 3% respectively, with the wholesale price of diesel falling for the fourth consecutive month. These reductions were fuelled by the falling oil price which underwent a 17% drop, with a barrel of oil coming down from $43.26 to $35.75 by the end of the month, taking it to a price last seen in June 2004. The barrel price tumbled to below $40 on Monday 7th December, paving the way for the sub-£1 litre, and has stayed below ever since. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “December was an excellent month for petrol car drivers with all four major supermarkets cutting the price of petrol to under £1 a litre on 11 December shortly after the RAC predicted it would happen. Unfortunately, despite the wholesale price of diesel being on average 2p a litre cheaper than that of petrol since 8 December, we didn’t see the pump price fall to the same level until a few days ago.  “It looks very much as though the supermarkets will have attracted extra customers into their stores before Christmas with the headline-grabbing price of 99.9p a litre for petrol but have cleverly made up for any lost profit by taking a bigger margin on diesel sales by not passing on the savings in wholesale price to motorists on the forecourt. “Supermarkets play a very important role in the fuel market as, despite only having 16% of all forecourt sites, they are responsible for 44% of the volume of all fuel sales. This means their prices affect what other nearby retailers charge as well as being highly influential on the nationwide average prices of both petrol and diesel. “Retailers have established a pretty good track record of passing on wholesale cost-savings at the pump over the period since the price of oil fell from $115 a barrel in June 2014. But not cutting the price of diesel when there was an opportunity to do so before Christmas has undermined that. While we still expect fuel prices to stay low for some time, it will be interesting to see how quickly pump prices go up again when the cost of oil rises. Of course, this tends to happen with little publicity in contrast to the fanfare that accompanies price reductions. “For average prices of both petrol and diesel to reach the £1 a litre mark, it would require a further drop in the wholesale price of petrol to be passed on by retailers, and for diesel pump prices to more closely reflect the recent reductions seen on the wholesale market. If retail pricing more directly mirrored wholesale movements then the average price of diesel should move nearer £1 a litre, but sadly unleaded may rise due to the weakening pound.” HMRC oil duty statistics for November* show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 2.7% up on October at 4.011bn litres and 0.3% up on the previous November. Petrol sales were down 1.6% (1.437bn litres) on October and down 4.1% compared to November 2014. Diesel, however, saw the highest number of litres sold in any month since 1990 with 2.574bn. This was 5.3% up on the month before and 2.9% up on November 2014.  Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Supermarkets should lead the way by selling diesel for under £1 a litre&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 16, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;With petrol being sold all over the country for under £1 a litre as a result of retailers passing on wholesale cost-savings, the RAC is now urging the supermarkets to, as a minimum, drop the price of diesel to match the price of petrol. As the wholesale price of diesel is now 3p\xa0a litre cheaper than unleaded, the RAC believes the major supermarkets – which lead the market on forecourt fuel prices – are in danger of being seen to take the country’s 11m diesel car drivers and Britain’s 3m-plus ‘white van’ men for a ride as there is no reason diesel should be priced higher than petrol. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Simon Williams said: “We hope the initial tight margins involved in selling petrol for under £1 haven’t led retailers to try to make up their lost profit by pricing diesel higher than it should be.  “Even though we saw the price of diesel drop below that of petrol on many forecourts a few months ago, there must be a temptation for retailers to maintain the differential and take advantage of motorists who have – over a period of years – become used to paying more for diesel than unleaded at the pump.  “As a result of two new refineries in Saudi Arabia coming on-stream, wholesale diesel is more widely available than ever before which means the price should be far cheaper going forward than in previous years. This, coupled with an oil price that has been below $40 a barrel for the last week, and still appears to be falling, should make it possible for diesel to be sold for under £1 a litre by the vast majority of retailers.” RAC Fuel Watch, which monitors the same data as retailers use to inform their buying decisions, reports that the wholesale price of diesel was below that of petrol all last week and was at a similar level to petrol the week before. While the wholesale price of diesel is currently 3p lower per litre than petrol, the average price at the pump was 3p more expensive at 107.72p on Monday 14th December compared to petrol at 104.37 which dropped almost 2p since Friday as a result of the sub-£1 litre.  Simon Williams added: “After breaking through the $40 mark, the price of a barrel of Brent Crude has continued to drop and stood at $36.81 when the markets closed on Monday, a price last seen in December 2008. Similarly, the pound has made up some of the ground it lost on the dollar in the last fortnight so wholesale prices are continuing to stay low, and in the case of diesel has fallen. This means we should see petrol stay around £1 a litre for a while, with diesel joining it if retailers are fair to motorists and pass on the savings.  “Our Fuel Watch data shows the average price of diesel should come down by about 6p to around £1 from its current average price which indicates that the wholesale cost-savings haven’t been passed on quickly enough.” While traditionally the focus of attention is on the headline price of unleaded due to the country having around 19m petrol cars, in reality total diesel sales are over 60% greater than petrol. Every day in the UK on average 74m litres of diesel are sold compared to 46m litres of petrol*. The RAC says the long-term outlook is for the oil price to stay low. OPEC is not due to meet again until June 2016 so unless an extraordinary meeting is called, there is good reason to believe production will continue to outpace demand and in turn keep wholesale fuel prices low.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol to fall to £1 a litre for Christmas as oil goes below $40&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 09, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Motorists will be treated to petrol at £1 a litre or under in time for Christmas if retailers ‘do the right thing’ and pass on savings in the wholesale price brought about by oil falling below $40 a barrel for the first time since February 2009. Britain’s supermarkets and cheapest fuel retailers will give motorists an early Christmas present in the next week, making it cheaper to visit family and friends at the most expensive time of year. And, the even better news is the sight of £1 a litre should become commonplace. RAC Fuel Watch data shows oil slipped even further following OPEC’s meeting in Vienna on Friday where delegates dismissed cutting production to stabilise the price. The end of day price for a barrel of Brent crude fell from $41.80 last Friday to $39.77 on Monday. This led to significant reductions in the wholesale price of both unleaded and diesel which the RAC believes will lead to a cut of 3p a litre in the average price of petrol and 5p a litre off diesel, taking average prices to around 103p for petrol and 104p for diesel. Diesel is already at a six-year low, with the average price reaching 109.18p on Friday. At these prices motorists would be saving around £9 on tank of petrol for an average 55-litre family car compared to this time last year, and more than £11 for a tank of diesel. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Simon Williams said: “With the price of wholesale unleaded dropping due to oil falling below $40 the climate is right for £1 a litre petrol, all we need is for the supermarkets to do the right thing and embrace the season of goodwill by passing on those savings at the pump to make Christmas that bit cheaper for everyone. “Motorists have already enjoyed petrol at under £1 as one supermarket cut prices at its 277 nationwide forecourts as part of a three-day promotion at the end of November, but this should now become a common sight across the country. If retailers don’t pass on the savings quickly, they will be giving themselves an unpopular Christmas boost to profits by pocketing the extra margin when they should really be passing this on to their customers instead. “The long-term outlook is for the oil price to stay low. OPEC is not due to meet again until June 2016 so unless an extraordinary meeting is called, it is anticipated production will continue to outpace demand and in turn keep wholesale fuel prices low.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;A landmark fuel month: diesel drops to lowest price in six years and petrol drops for fifth month in a row&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 03, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;November was a landmark month for the UK fuel market with both the lowest average pump price for diesel in six years as oil tumbled to $40.40 – the lowest barrel price since February 2009 – and the first widespread sight of petrol being sold for under £1 a litre again. RAC Fuel Watch data for November also showed the average price of petrol reduced for the fifth month in a row from 107.67p at the start to 106.98p as well as hitting a nine-month low on 11 November at 106.92p. Diesel, however, reduced to its lowest average price since late December 2009 when it reached 109.48p a litre on 30 November, having started the month at 109.77p. This means since this time last year the cost of filling up a 55-litre family car with petrol has plunged by £7.75 and a tank of diesel has come down even more, with a fill-up now £8.95 cheaper than a year ago. The RAC’s prediction of petrol being sold for under £1 also came true with one leading supermarket reacting to the falling oil price and cheaper wholesale fuel by treating customers at its 277 nationwide forecourts to a three-day promotion of petrol at 99.7p a litre. Another linked a £40 in-store spend to a 7p-a-litre forecourt discount taking petrol below the £1 mark. The RAC Fuel Watch report shows a barrel of crude oil fell over $3 in November, coming down from $47.32 to $44.03, with the six-year low of $40.40 being seen on 16 November. Unfortunately, the pound lost a little ground to the dollar – with a pound worth $1.54 at the start of the month and $1.51 at the end – undoing some of the positive effect of the lower oil price as oil is traded in dollars. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Simon Williams said: “In the expensive run-up to Christmas, drivers of both petrol and diesel vehicles are benefitting from far cheaper fill-ups than they did at this time last year. While petrol for under a pound a litre has become a reality at the cheapest retailers we would like to see this happen on a non-promotional basis. This depends, of course, on the cost of a barrel of oil staying low and ideally trading down a little closer to $40 for longer – something which is very hard to predict, particularly as OPEC meet tomorrow (4 December) in Vienna to discuss oil production strategy. “There has been talk of stabilising the barrel price which would mean stemming production, but it’s difficult to see how that would work when Iran begins to pump up to one million barrels a day in 2016, following on from its landmark nuclear agreement with the West. “The lower forecourt prices we’re enjoying at the moment are a product of the fall in world crude oil prices, which began in September 2014. After a six-year low of $45 a barrel in early February and two instances of going back up to the $60 level twice briefly since, the price has been consistently below $50 since mid-October, reaching a new six-year low in mid-November. “As it stands we anticipate a very slight average petrol price reduction in the next two weeks and another 2p a litre coming off diesel, taking the new six-year average low price even lower.” HMRC oil duty statistics for October* show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 1.9% up on September at 3.905bn litres and up 1.8% on the previous October. Petrol sales (1.461bn litres) were static on September whereas October saw the fifth highest number of litres sold in any month since 1990 with 2.444bn. This was 2.9% up on the month before and 3.7% up on October 2014.  Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel price cuts expected as oil hits $40 a barrel&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Nov 18, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The price of a barrel of oil fell to $40.40 – its lowest price since February 2009 – on Monday, paving the way for another round of pump cuts and making the sight of £1 a litre at the cheapest forecourts ever more likely. RAC Fuel Watch data shows Brent crude dropped nearly $2 a barrel from Friday and $5 from a week ago, pushing down wholesale petrol and diesel prices and signalling expected pump reductions of around 2p a litre in the next fortnight.  The average price of petrol, which has fallen for the last four months, currently stands at 108.01p whereas diesel is at 110.24p, still close to the September price of 109.76p which was its lowest since December 2009. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Events in Paris made oil traders react on Monday causing a sudden dip in the price of Brent crude to the $40 mark which has not been seen for more than six years. With oil prices already consistently low as a result of too much supply, the dip – even though it will be temporary – should still be reflected in wholesale prices, making fuel cheaper for motorists.  “We hope retailers will be quick to pass on these new wholesale fuel savings at the pumps to make the cost of litre cheaper still. A barrel of oil has now not been above $50 since mid-October and not consistently above that mark since the end of July. “After a summer of lower forecourt prices, motorists are now looking forward to the prospect of yet lower petrol and diesel in the run-up to the expensive festive period. While we are a way off average petrol prices reaching £1 a litre, there is a good chance the most price-competitive fuel retailers will take the plunge.” The price of a barrel of oil began to tumble a year ago having been as high as $115 in mid-2014 and fell to $45 in mid-January which led to the average petrol price reaching a six-year low of 106.09p in early February. While the barrel price rebounded to the $60 level in late February/early March and in late June/early July, it dropped again and has subsequently stayed low. And, even after hitting $40.40 on Monday (16 November), it only went back up slightly on Tuesday, finishing at $41.56. Simon Williams added: “Low oil and fuel prices appear to be here to stay as cutting supply to shore up prices is not an option for OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – as it is dead set on not letting its competitors take any of its share, something which would almost certainly happen with a higher barrel price. With yet more oil due to hit the market as Iran begins to produce again following its nuclear deal with the West, the long-term outlook has to be low oil prices for a further 12 months. “Let’s just hope the Chancellor doesn’t spoil the party by using lower prices as an excuse to raise fuel duty in his Autumn Statement next week. The Treasury’s own research shows that lower fuel prices can boost economic GDP and at a time where some think tanks are predicting the economy will slow, surely the best way to keep the country moving and keep the economy going is to freeze fuel duty.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of petrol falls for fourth consecutive month&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Nov 04, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot; The average price of petrol fell for the fourth consecutive month with a further 1.6p being shaved off a litre in October, according to the latest RAC Fuel Watch data. Unleaded finished the month at 107.82p, down from 109.45p at the start, saving another 90p from the cost of filling up an average 55-litre family car. This means since the start of July it costs £5.08 less to fill up with unleaded and £5.87 less for diesel.  Diesel, however, only reduced fractionally in October from 110.26p to 109.95p but is still not far off the lowest price since December 2009 which was recorded in the first week of September at 109.76p. The continued run of lower fuel prices is being driven by the oil price which remains below $50 a barrel despite a 2% increase throughout the month. The RAC Fuel Watch report for October showed a barrel of crude maintained an average price of $48 a barrel, although there was greater fluctuation in October than in previous months with a five-day spell early on where a barrel went over $50 and a dramatic dip towards the end of the month when a barrel hit $45.95 (27 October) – this was almost as low as mid-January ($45.26) when petrol was the lowest it had been for six years (106.09p).  The pound made 2% gain on the dollar ($1.51 to $1.54) helping to keep the wholesale price of petrol and diesel lower as both fuels are traded in dollars. The RAC is currently expecting little change in pump prices over the next fortnight. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “We are currently enjoying a sustained period of lower fuel prices as a result of the long-term deflated oil price which has been brought about by OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – looking to stop competitors taking its share of the market by overproducing and keeping the barrel price low. “A year ago motorists had probably become accustomed to only ever seeing prices go up so having four consecutive months of the petrol price coming down is a pleasant surprise. Fuel is without doubt the biggest cost of motoring and the forecourt price is a constant cause of concern for drivers which makes this relief at the pumps all the more welcome.  “The question is how low will prices go, albeit with the caveat that two-thirds of every till receipt is made up of tax through fuel duty at 57.95p a litre and VAT on top. And, as prices head towards the £1 mark, the tax take rises to 75%.” HMRC oil duty statistics for September show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 3.5% down on August at 3.834bn litres but 1.9% up compared to August 2014. Petrol sales (1.460bn) were 1.1% down on August and diesel (2.374bn) was 5% down on the month before but 2.95% up on the previous August.

Diesel stayed almost the same around the 110p-a-litre mark (109.86p on 1 September to 110.36p on 30 September), but the petrol/diesel price flip was finally reversed after nearly two months of diesel being cheaper than unleaded. \r\n\tThe RAC Fuel Watch report for September reveals that the average price of diesel returned to being more expensive than unleaded on Friday 25 September (petrol 110.01p v diesel 110.27p), having fallen below petrol on Wednesday 29 July\xa0for the first time since summer 2001. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Petrol has now returned to its traditional position of being cheaper than diesel. This is primarily due to lower demand for unleaded as a result of the US summer holiday driving season finishing at the end of August. A secondary factor is that the diesel wholesale price has stayed stronger than petrol because, in the run-up to winter, there is now less diesel in the marketplace – more oil from that ‘part of the barrel’ is being used to produce more profitable domestic heating oil. \r\n\t“The cost of wholesale unleaded fell 2% in September, hopefully paving the way for further reductions at the pump – we predict at least another 2p-a-litre saving to be passed on by retailers within the next fortnight. \r\n\t“The continued lower prices of both petrol and diesel are a result of ongoing low oil prices. The cost of a barrel of crude has now been below $50 since 31 August and is 3% cheaper than it was at the start of September, having come down from $48.98 a barrel to $47.31. The effect of this on pump prices would have been greater had the pound not lost a little ground on the dollar in September.” \r\n\tSince the start of July, the average forecourt price of unleaded has dropped 7p a litre from 117p to the current 109.63p, making a tank £4 cheaper. Diesel, however, has plummeted 10p a litre from 120.63p to 110.36p, giving drivers a saving of £5.65 every time they fill up from empty. \nHMRC oil duty statistics for August show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 1.8% up on July at 3.975bn litres. Petrol sales (1.476bn) were the same as July but down 5.6% on July 2014, whereas diesel (2.499bn) was up 2.7% on the month before and 2.8% ahead of the previous July, making for the second highest number of litres ever sold, only behind November 2014 when 2,501bn litres were sold. \nThe following table shows 3 month, 6 month and 12 month price and percentage change, compared to\xa030/9/2015: \n\n Notes to Editors For all media\xa0enquiries,\xa0please contact the RAC\xa0press office team on +44 (0)1454 664 123.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel falls more than 4p a litre in August as oil price plummets to six-year low&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Sep 03, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;A new 12-month oil low of $41.87 in the last week of August helped to bring the average price of petrol down by 4p a litre for the month to 112.42p, according to the latest RAC Fuel Watch data. Diesel also continued to drop throughout August with a further 5p being shaved off a litre taking the average cost down to 110.40p, still keeping it below petrol. This means motorists are now paying £2 less to fill up an average family-sized petrol car than they were at the start of the month and £2.60 less for a diesel car. The fall in pump prices has been driven by a dramatic reduction in the price of oil. In the run-up to August, oil was at a consistent $60 a barrel, but dipped below $50 a barrel at the start of the month and stayed below $50 for the whole month, reaching a low point of $41.87 on 24 August. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “We thought July had been a good month for motorists but August proved to be better still due to world oil prices reaching their lowest since February 2009. In January we saw oil go down to $45 but then recover to around the $60-a-barrel mark where it stayed for several months until this new level of over-production in August led to a dramatic reduction. “Diesel drivers have benefitted the most this summer due to a new supply of diesel from Saudi Arabia bringing the wholesale price down. They are now paying £5.60 less to fill up than they were at the beginning of July whereas the savings for petrol motorists have only just kicked in with the drop in the price of oil feeding through into lower wholesale and retail prices. “The good times at the pump may, however, be coming to an end as OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which produces 40% of the world’s oil – has said it is willing to meet with other oil producers to discuss a ‘fair’ price for oil. The barrel price has already rebounded and is continuing to trade up around $48 so we may not see a low of $41 a barrel again.  “Due to the global oil over-supply situation we are in, pump prices look unlikely to return to the all-time high levels of 142p for petrol and 147p for diesel experienced in April 2012 so the cost of driving should continue to be cheaper for some time to come.” HMRC oil duty statistics for July* show fuel sales were 1.6% down on June with a 2.4% drop in the number of litres of diesel sold from 2.494bn to 2.433bn. Petrol sales were static at 1.472bn litres, however, compared to July 2014 combined fuel sales were 3.5% up – 2.3% for petrol and 4.3% for diesel.

At the start of the month diesel was 120.63p, but by the end it had dropped almost 5p to 115.74p. And, on Wednesday 29 Julythe country saw the first forecourt price flip between diesel and petrol since summer 2001 with diesel at 116.28p, just below the average petrol price of 116.64p. Half a penny a litre also came off the petrol price in the month, which reduced from 117.05p to 116.51p. Both petrol and diesel wholesale prices remain low as a result of the price of oil falling below the $60 a barrel mark on 3 July and remaining there ever since. In the course of the month the oil price fell 9% from $61 to $52 a barrel. This combined with the pound staying strong against the dollar at $1.56 is keeping petrol and diesel cheaper.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “July was a month of good news for motorists with diesel vehicles. The 5p a litre diesel saving recorded in July means the cost of filling up an average 55-litre diesel family car, such as a Ford Focus, has dropped by £3 in a month. This is particularly welcome for motorists setting out on their annual holidays who are driving long distances to destinations in the UK.  “And, if the supermarkets continue to battle over prices as they pass on further wholesale cost savings, pump prices should reduce to around an average of 111p a litre – a price last seen in January 2010. This would shave another £2 off a tank of diesel. To put this in perspective, this is even lower than the 113p average price reached in January after oil hit a near six-year low of $45 a barrel. “The cheaper wholesale price of diesel – now almost 6p a litre cheaper than petrol – has been brought about by the fact two new refineries in Saudi Arabia are now producing diesel to meet the large European demand. We expect this to be good long-term news for the nation’s 10.7m diesel car drivers as well as for businesses operating commercial vehicles. Everyone should benefit from a better, fairer deal at the pumps going forwards.” HMRC fuel usage statistics for June show 2.5bn litres of diesel were sold – a 4% increase on May. Petrol sales remained static at 1.5bn litres. Compared to June 2014; however, petrol was down 4% and diesel was up 5%. Combined fuel sales generated £2.3bn revenue for the Government in fuel duty. This was 2.5% up on May and 1.4% up on June 2014. Notes to Editors Media release issued by the RAC. For all media\xa0enquiries, please contact the press team on +44 (0)1454 664 123.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Diesel wholesale cheaper than petrol throughout June, yet pump price gap still remains&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jul 03, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;Despite the wholesale price of diesel being cheaper than petrol for all of June motorists are still paying 3p a litre more at the pumps. The RAC’s Fuel Watch report for June shows the price of diesel has become the ‘elephant in the room’ with wholesale prices 1p to 3p a litre lower than petrol yet the average price of a litre of diesel is 120p, compared to 117p for petrol. While some retailers have closed the gap between petrol and diesel on the forecourt, more closely reflecting wholesale prices, very few – if any – have moved their diesel price below petrol. In fact, the vast majority of retailers continue to keep a significant gap between the two fuels with diesel often 5p a litre more expensive. The latter group may be operating on wafer thin margins on petrol in order to remain competitive and trading this off against bigger margins on diesel in order to balance the books. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The retail price of diesel has almost become a taboo subject despite 2.4bn litres being sold in May, compared to just 1.5bn litres of petrol. While there are twice as many petrol cars on the road, the increase in diesel usage shown in government statistics and the new car sales figures which show more than 50% of cars and light commercial vehicles leaving the showroom are powered by diesel, confirm that we are increasingly relying on diesel for both business and private use. “Not only are diesel drivers now being demonised due to the increasing concerns over harmful nitrogen dioxide and particulate emissions, they are consistently having to pay a premium for their fuel. And, all this comes after years in which the taxation system has encouraged motorists to buy low carbon dioxide emitting vehicles. This has led to a big take-up of small fuel efficient diesel vehicles by motorists believing their choice of vehicle was good for the environment as well as their pocket. “While retailers are obviously free to choose how much they charge for petrol and diesel, we believe that motorists deserve to be treated fairly and that means forecourt prices that reflect the wholesale market.”  The RAC’s Fuel Watch report shows that the price of diesel should drop by around 5p a litre in the next two weeks based on lower wholesale prices, although the motoring organisation has seen this throughout June with little to no forecourt price change so therefore has little hope of this saving being passed on. Simon Williams added: “Essentially, what is required is a fundamental re-balance of pricing in the retail fuel market. We need greater transparency and a fairer pricing model for both petrol and diesel. We realise that with more and more forecourts shutting up shop every month that fuel retailing may not be as profitable as it once was, but there seems to be a clear intention to make more money from a higher diesel price while at the same time being seen to maintain a lower petrol price.  “We as a nation of motorists are far more focused on petrol prices and therefore there is a perceived benefit from a retailer’s point of view in keeping petrol prices lower for the country’s 20m petrol car owners than it is for the 10m-plus diesel car drivers.” June saw fuel prices maintain an even keel for motorists as a result of oil prices staying flat and the pound remaining stable too. The average price of a litre of petrol was 117p – 14p cheaper than 12 months ago, and diesel was 120.75p – 15p cheaper. Both have gone up since the early February average price lows of 106p for unleaded and 113p for diesel. HMRC fuel usage statistics for May* show the Government brought in £2.2bn in fuel duty revenue – a similar figure to April. This represented a 2.8% year-on-year growth in revenue – £2.182bn in May 2014 compared to £2.243bn in May 2015. May saw 1.478bn litres of petrol and 2.393bn diesel sold, making for a total of 3.871bn litres. Petrol sales experienced a 1.5% month-on-month growth and diesel a 1% drop on April, but year-on-year petrol declined by 1.6% compared to May 2014 and diesel usage grew by 5.7%. \r\n\tIssued by the RAC.

Data from RAC Fuel Watch* reveals petrol went up by another 2.34p to 130.57p in May while diesel increased by 1.74p to 135.54p. This is in stark contrast to 3 February when a litre of unleaded cost an average of 119.54p and diesel was 128.64p.  As a result of the rises petrol is only a penny away from its five-year high of 131.58p which was recorded on 15 October 2018 – the last time unleaded was more expensive than this was 15 July 2014 (131.61p). Diesel hit 136.94p a litre on 30 October – prior to that it was last this high on 10 March 2014 (137.17p). The May pump price increases mean a tank of petrol for a 55-litre family car now costs an average of £71.81 – an increase of £1.29 in May and £6 more than at the start of February. The cost of filling a diesel car also went up by £1 (96p) to £74.55 – £3.80 more than four months ago. The diesel rise is particularly frustrating for the UK’s 13m diesel cars** as the wholesale price has merited substantial forecourt cuts for some weeks. The rise in forecourt prices has been caused by a continued increase in wholesale prices. May unfortunately saw the bad combination of a slightly higher oil price and a weakening pound. The price of crude oil traded well above $70 a barrel for most of the month and the pound lost ground on the dollar, falling from $1.30 to $1.26 – a 4% drop. However, by the end of the month oil had fallen to $65 (-9%) – a price not seen since mid-March, perhaps signalling some much-needed price easing at the pumps.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “May was another miserable month for drivers with the fourth straight average price rise of both petrol and diesel taking us near to a five-year high. Luckily though, oil closed out the month 9% lower at $65 which should soon translate to lower prices at the pumps. “After suffering a steady flow of daily fuel price increases because of rising wholesale costs we urge retailers to reflect this sudden drop in the price of oil by cutting their prices as soon as possible. The supermarkets who buy fuel more often than smaller retailers due to the large volumes they sell should be able to do this straightaway to bring some welcome relief to drivers who have had to endure seemingly ever-increasing prices. “Despite this, the price of diesel has been over-inflated for more than a month. In fact, the wholesale price of diesel has now been lower than petrol since 17 May, yet there is currently an average difference of 5p between the two on our forecourts. Consequently, there is scope to cut the price of diesel by at least 6p a litre. In reality, however, the majority of retailers will no doubt refuse to do this and instead continue to use the saving from the lower diesel wholesale price to subsidise the ‘headline’ petrol price with a view to attracting more customers to their forecourts and stores. “Looking at the bigger picture, until late in May the outlook for fuel prices appeared bleak, but for once the notorious volatility of the oil price might just work in favour of drivers as there are fears supply may start to outstrip demand. This is due to a possible global economic slowdown being sparked by the US’s trade wars with China and Mexico as well as it producing record levels of crude oil. “OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its partners could still put a fly in the ointment as a meeting is scheduled in Vienna for the end of June to discuss production levels. The alliance has been working together on limiting oil production since early 2017 but increased its curbs at the beginning of this year. If they were to decide to go still further this would serve to prop up the barrel price, which inevitably won’t be good news for motorists.”   Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices The North East saw the largest monthly price increase in the UK with 2.71p, taking a litre to 130.25p. London started May with the most expensive unleaded at 129.29p but the South East had the dearest petrol by the end of the month at 131.41p. Northern Ireland was the cheapest throughout May, finishing the month with an average price of 128.99p. Regional average diesel pump prices The East Midlands endured the biggest increase in the cost of diesel with a litre going up to 135.81p on the back of a 1.95p rise. The South East had the most expensive diesel at 136.46p and Northern Ireland the cheapest at 132.56p. Northern Ireland also had the smallest monthly increase at 1.31p a litre.

Data from RAC Fuel Watch* shows a litre of unleaded shot up from 122.62p to 128.06p as retailers passed on wholesale price increases driven by a 5% jump in the cost of a barrel of oil which went up more than $3 to $72.50, having hit a high of $74.38 earlier in the month. It means April 2019 was officially one of the bleakest months for petrol prices in nearly 20 years. April’s price leap is second only to May 2018 when petrol jumped 6p a litre (5.98p) from 123.43p to 129.41p. It is also the third consecutive month of price rises, meaning unleaded has gone up 8.5p a litre from 119.54p to 128.06p since the beginning of February. Diesel also increased by 3p a litre from 130.70p to 133.70p. While not as great an increase as petrol it was still the 18th biggest monthly rise since 2000 – the largest being 8.43p in May 2008.  RAC Fuel Watch also shows the average difference between petrol and diesel wholesale prices was only a penny throughout April, yet the retail price of diesel was an average of 6p a litre more expensive than petrol throughout the month. In terms of filling an average 55-litre family car, the unleaded price rise means the cost has gone up by £3 to £70.43 and for diesel by £1.65 to £73.54. The country’s four big supermarket fuel retailers – Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury – actually increased their petrol prices above the UK average. Their average for unleaded went up by 5.58p a litre from 118.62p to 124.20p (in contrast to the UK average price which rose by 5.44p), with diesel going up by 4.1p from 127.47p to 131.57p.  Motorway petrol went up 3.6p from an average of 141.93p to 145.53p while diesel increased 2.79p from 151.27p to 154.06p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Despite the good weather April turned out to be one of the bleakest months ever for drivers with the second biggest monthly rise in the price of petrol for nearly 20 years.  “RAC Fuel Watch data shows the price of unleaded rose every single day from the end of March for three and half weeks (until 24 April), which is the longest run of daily price rises since May last year when unleaded increased 6p a litre setting a new monthly price rise record dating back to 2000. “The bad news for drivers is that a tank of petrol now costs £3 more than it did at the start of April. This will have a damaging effect on household budgets across the country and will inevitably mean there will be less money available for non-essential spending. “But diesel drivers have much to be aggrieved about as the fuel not only suffered a 3p a litre hike in price, its pump price was 6p higher than petrol on average in April – despite the fact its wholesale cost was very similar to that of petrol.  “It is very clear from our monitoring of forecourt and wholesale prices that retailers have been using the cheaper wholesale cost of diesel to subsidise petrol pump prices and had they not, a new monthly price rise record would have been set. As a result diesel drivers – and businesses that doesn’t buy fuel in advance – are now all paying far more than they should be. To put this pricing discrepancy in perspective, last year the amount of diesel sold was almost double that of petrol (30.5bn v 15.8bn litres). “The rise in forecourt prices is being driven by the increase in the cost of oil which has been brought about by oil producer group OPEC and non-member Russia working together to restrict oil supply, coupled with lower production from Venezuela and Libya due to troubles and US sanctions on Iran. “OPEC is due to meet at the end of next month in Vienna so we can only hope for a relaxation of production targets.” Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices Drivers in Wales had to endure the biggest increase in the price of unleaded with a litre going up 6.1p in April. The South East had the most expensive petrol at the start of the month, but London took the title by the close, with the average price of a litre in the city reaching 129.02p. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest petrol as well as the smallest monthly price rise at 4.89p a litre.  Regional average diesel pump prices The East of England not only had the largest jump in the price of diesel – 3.34p a litre – it also had the most expensive diesel at the end of the month at 134.67p. Northern Ireland also had the cheapest average pump prices at the beginning and end of April, and the smallest monthly increase at just 2.48p a litre.

This means filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded now costs £67.22. The average price of diesel also increased but only 0.70p to 130.67p taking a fill-up to £71.87. This is the second straight monthly increase for both fuels, making unleaded 2p more expensive than it was at the same time in 2018 and 2017 (120.11p – 2018; 120.15p - 2017).  Diesel, however, is nearly 8p dearer (122.82p – 2018; 122.19p – 2017), or £4.30 a tank. But the current price of petrol is still 8p a litre cheaper than it was in October last year (131p), which was the highest price seen since July 2014, and diesel is also 6p cheaper than it was in October (136p in October). The pump price rises have been fuelled by a 4% jump in the cost of oil from $63.81 to $68.07 and a 2% drop in the value of the pound against the dollar ($1.32 to $1.30) – the worst possible combination for motorists. The increase in the wholesale cost of petrol, which equated to 6.5p in March, started to be passed on by the supermarket fuel retailers immediately. This led to a litre of supermarket petrol going up 1.7p in March to 118.59p and a litre of diesel rising 1.27p to 127.48p. Asda and Sainsbury’s both raised their prices by 2p a litre in the month. Asda, however, began a series of almost daily rises from late February, making for a 3.6p litre hike by the close of March (113.7p – 21 Feb to 117.31p – 31 March).  As a result of Asda’s increases, which weren’t mirrored by the other three major supermarkets, the gap between the country’s cheapest fuel retailer on petrol and the other supermarkets has closed. From the end of October until the end of February the other three supermarkets were charging around 3p more for a litre of petrol than Asda but this has now closed again to the customary 1p to 1.5p.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “March has been another rough month for petrol drivers. Unleaded has gone up 2p a litre and diesel by just short of a penny. Diesel drivers are particularly feeling the pinch at the moment, as compared to this time last year and the year before a litre is on average 8p more expensive than petrol. Worse still, diesel is also 8p dearer than it was at this time in both 2018 and 2017. “Throughout March the wholesale price of diesel was on average 6p a litre more than petrol. This gap has now closed which should hopefully bring some relief to drivers of diesel vehicles. If retailers play fair with motorists the price of the fuel should fall by around 3p a litre in the next fortnight whereas petrol looks like it’s set to rise further with at least a penny or two likely to go on in the coming weeks.  “Fortunately, normal competition between supermarket fuel retailers over the price of petrol has resumed after four months of Asda being considerably cheaper than its competitors. Whether this is as a result of keener pricing from the others or from Asda moving its unleaded price closer to its competitors is hard to know.  “Supermarkets play a vital role in UK fuel retailing as despite only having a fifth of forecourt sites they have 45% of the fuel market which means that everyone else selling fuel has little option but to compete with them. And, if there isn’t good competition between them it can mean the UK average price of fuel is adversely affected, to the disadvantage of all drivers.” Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices  Regional average diesel pump prices Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting the RAC Fuel Watch webpage.

Data from\xa0RAC Fuel Watch shows the UK average price of a litre of petrol increased by just under a penny (0.88p) to 120.42p by the end of the month while diesel climbed more than a penny (1.24p) to 129.88p.  Since the beginning of November 11p a litre came off the average price of unleaded, taking it from 130.61p to 119.60p at the end of January. Diesel also reduced, but not by as much, instead falling 8p a litre from 136.93p to 128.74p over the same period. As a result of the February price rise, filling up an average 55-litre family car with petrol now costs £66.23 and with diesel £71.43.  The big four supermarkets only raised their prices slightly to 117p for unleaded (up 0.30p) and to 126.10p for diesel (up 0.48p). This was led by Asda, which after more than six weeks of keeping its prices the same, took the decision to pass on slight increases in wholesale prices to its customers.  The price rises were driven by a 5% jump in the price of oil which added $3 across the month taking the barrel price up to $65.13 by the close of February, although at one point it topped $67 – a price not seen since mid-November last year. The increase in the price of crude has been driven by production cuts made by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) in partnership with Russia.  From a driver’s point of view, the oil price increase was softened a little by a 2% strengthening of the pound against the dollar, which is important as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars. The pound started the month at $1.30 and closed at $1.33. The combination of the oil price rise and the slight strengthening of the pound led to the wholesale price of unleaded rising by under a penny (0.82p) a litre and diesel by 1.82p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Drivers will be disappointed to see prices at the pumps going up again after enjoying three months of reductions.  “What they probably aren’t aware of is that retailers, who held off cuts for weeks when they were warranted, instantly raised their prices when they saw the wholesale price go up very slightly. This is unfortunately clear proof of the infamous ‘rocket and feather’ pricing strategy where prices go up like a rocket and fall like a feather. “Even the cheapest supermarket fuel retailer Asda which held its average petrol price at 113.7p since mid-January flinched, adding more than 1.5p a litre in four days. It will be interesting to see if this comes off again as the wholesale price eased almost straightaway.  “Currently, retailers should actually be reducing their unleaded prices a little, but it remains to be seen whether they will pass on the savings to drivers on the forecourt. Based on their current track record you would have to say this seems unlikely.” Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices London and the North East suffered the biggest rises in the price of unleaded, with 1.18p added on their forecourts. The South East had the dearest petrol at both the start and end of the month but only saw 0.71p go on to its average price. Wales saw the smallest increase and also had the cheapest petrol by the close of February.  London also endured the greatest increase in the price of diesel and had the most expensive price by the end of the month with a litre going up by 1.53p to 130.67p. At 1.28.18p Northern Ireland had the lowest price diesel in the UK.

Data from RAC Fuel Watch* shows the UK average price of unleaded came down by 1.32p to 120.92p while diesel dropped 1.27p to 130.01p. This means it now costs an average of £65.78 to fill up a 55-litre family car with petrol – £6 less than it did at the end of October. A tank of diesel, however, has only come down £3.78 to £71.50 over the same period.  Prices at the country’s four biggest supermarkets are an average of 3p a litre lower at 116.66p for petrol and 125.43p for diesel. At motorway service areas, however, a litre of unleaded sets drivers back 138.87p and diesel 147.55p. RAC Fuel Watch figures show the wholesale price of petrol stayed flat in January while diesel increased by 2p a litre, but when compared to retail prices they were low still low enough to demand pump price reductions during the month. Sadly for drivers though, retailers decided not to pass these on.  The RAC says this explains why the UK average price of fuel has fallen despite the wholesale market being static for unleaded and rising for diesel. If retailers were to pass on existing savings in their wholesale costs the price of petrol ought to reduce by 3p a litre in the next two weeks, and diesel by 2p a litre. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “While it’s obviously good news the price of fuel has fallen for three months in a row, the story behind the simple forecourt average figures is quite disturbing. Looking at the wholesale data over the last two months reveals that we should have been paying far less for our petrol and diesel than we have been.  “Unfortunately, three of supermarket fuel retailers appear to have changed their pricing policies for the long term by increasing the margin they take on a litre of petrol to about 2p. This has meant the average price of unleaded has not reduced by as much as it should have because smaller retailers nearby haven’t had to lower their prices as much in order to compete. “The wholesale fuel market operates very transparently, but the same can’t be said of the retail market. We understand retailers are free to charge what they like for their fuel and that it’s then up to consumers whether they’re prepared to pay their prices or not. Unfortunately, consumers don’t have an easy way of knowing whether they are being charged a fair price so they have to trust they aren’t being ripped off. That’s why we always encourage drivers to check the current average price of petrol and diesel, and see if they can beat that price when paying for fuel locally. “Combine this with the fact some bigger retailers vary their prices from location to location, fuel is an essential purchase for most people and that shopping around is not that easy, and you have the perfect recipe for drivers being charged over the odds for what is essentially a commodity.” Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices The North West saw the greatest reduction in the price of unleaded in the UK with 1.36p coming off a litre taking it to 118.95p. The North East, however, had the cheapest petrol at the start and close of January (118.98p and 117.95p). The South East was once again the most expensive.\xa0 Regional average diesel pump prices The East of England enjoyed a 1.59p drop in the price of diesel, surpassing the UK average fall of 1.27p.

The average price of unleaded went down 2.75p from 123.67p to 120.92p and diesel reduced by 3.08p from 133.09p to 130.01p. Oil, however, crashed 14.5% from $60.31 at the start of the month to $51.52 on 27 December which should have meant prices at the pump were considerably lower.  RAC Fuel Watch data shows the price of unleaded should come down in the next fortnight by more than 8p a litre to 113p a litre and diesel by 10p a litre to 120p if retailers passed on savings in the lower wholesale price. This would see the supermarkets charging around 110p a litre for petrol and 117p for diesel. At the end of December it cost on average £66.51 to fill up a 55-litre family car with unleaded – £1.51 less than November – and £71.51 for the equivalent diesel vehicle, and a saving of £1.69 on the previous month.  A litre of unleaded cost an average of 117.23p at the four biggest supermarkets, and diesel 126.76p. The average price at an Asda forecourt, however, was 114.7p a litre for petrol and 125.53p for diesel. At motorway service areas petrol was sold for an average of 138.48p and diesel for 148.14p. But despite the overall picture showing a reduction in the cost of fuel in December, the RAC fears fuel retailing among the big four supermarkets may have changed forever – to the detriment of every driver – as only Asda is close to reflecting the lower wholesale prices at the pumps.  Since mid-October the other supermarket fuel retailers have chosen not to compete as closely on the price of unleaded as they usually do – they are currently charging up to 4p a litre more for unleaded than Asda. As a result drivers across the UK have lost out as the average price of petrol should have dropped by that amount through the ripple effect caused by independents trying to match their closest supermarket rivals’ prices.  RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “While it’s good news fuel prices have fallen for the second month in a row, drivers should feel cheated they have not come down further. The problem is twofold: firstly, there should be a cut in the price of petrol to properly reflect lower wholesale prices and secondly, three of our biggest supermarkets appear no longer to be competing on the price of unleaded, in particular, as closely with the lowest price supermarket retailer, Asda. “Normally, the other three supermarkets are 1p to 1.5p more expensive on unleaded, but our data shows that since October they have abandoned this strategy in favour of pricing 2.5p to 4p higher for a litre of petrol. The decision by all supermarkets to take more profit on a litre has led to every driver having to pay more to fill up than they should have to. This is because the UK average is negatively affected as other retailers are not being forced through competition to lower their prices.  “This is a highly unusual situation, the likes of which we haven’t seen before. If this new pricing behaviour continues into 2019 this could spell a bleaker year for drivers at the pumps no matter what happens to the price of wholesale fuel. Drivers could be paying around 3p a litre more for their fuel simply because of a retail pricing decision at three supermarkets which together sell a high volume of fuel. This is important as supermarkets only operate 18% of the UK’s 8,422 forecourts but sell around 45% of all the fuel. “Of course, it should also be the case that smaller retailers ought to be moving their prices down on their own without having to be forced to do so by nearby supermarkets. We commend those smaller retailers that proactively do this. “Unfortunately, unless you live near the cheapest supermarket fuel retailer or an independent retailer that is very price-competitive, the amount you pay for your petrol and diesel is likely to be far higher than it should be. “It is important to point out that every fuel retailer is at liberty to charge what they want for their petrol or diesel so aside from the Government taking the unlikely step of capping retailer margins there is little that can be done to change this. Sadly, it means motorists are completely at the mercy of retailers because just one major supermarket passing on savings in the wholesale price isn’t enough to change prices across the majority of UK forecourts.  “Fortunately, despite the weakness of the pound against the dollar drivers are enjoying a cheaper time at the pumps than they were in the middle of 2018. This is due to the price of oil falling substantially due a glut in supply caused by a global economic slow-down. Even though oil producers group OPEC has agreed to limit supply there is still too much oil in circulation which has led to the price of barrel coming down.”  Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices Northern Ireland saw the biggest drop in the price of unleaded with a 3.91p reduction in a litre from 123.81p to 119.90p. The North East, however, while only seeing a 3p decrease had the cheapest petrol in the UK, finishing December at 119.20p. The East was charging the most for a litre of unleaded at the beginning of the month, but by the close the South East had regained its customary title, with an average price of 121.87p.   Regional average diesel pump prices Scotland enjoyed the biggest UK average reduction in the price of diesel, with 3.15p coming off a litre to a price of 130.27p. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest diesel at both the start and finish of the month and the South East was the dearest place in the UK to buy diesel with a litre costing 131.22p at the end of December.

RAC Fuel Watch data shows there was a 3.5p fall in the wholesale price yet unleaded started and finished the month at 130.6p a litre. This means the average cost of filling a 55-litre family car with petrol has stayed at £71.84 when it should have been nearly £2 less (£1.92) had retailers done the right thing and reflected the lower wholesale price on the forecourt. Even though conditions were ripe for a petrol price cut from the middle of the month the big four supermarket fuel retailers – which play a vital role in setting the market for fuel prices across the UK – refused to lower the price for drivers. It was not until the end of the month that Asda finally reduced unleaded by an average of 2.4p across all its forecourts.  But this has sadly not led to other retailers following suit by lowering their prices and has therefore had little effect either on the average price of unleaded at the supermarkets, or on the UK average. The average price of petrol at Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons actually increased by 0.6p a litre in October (126.88p to 127.48p) despite the drop in the wholesale cost. Diesel, however, suffered its fourth consecutive monthly price increase, rising by 2.38p from 134.50p to 136.88p, making the cost of a 55-litre tank £75.28. Buying it at a supermarket saves 3p a litre with the average price standing at 133.67p a litre at the end of October, having risen 2.35p from 131.32p. Refilling with petrol at a motorway service area, however, now costs an average of 149.32p – a slight reduction of 0.3p a litre on the start of the month when it was 149.62p. Frighteningly, a litre of diesel at a motorway forecourt is an average of 155.22p – an increase of 2.7p in October. A tank of petrol is therefore £82.29 while diesel is an eye-watering £85.37. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “Every motorist driving a petrol car should feel aggrieved that the price of a litre stayed the same in October when it should have fallen by more than 3p. The biggest retailers who are responsible for selling the most fuel have taken drivers for a ride.  “In doing so they have inadvertently but categorically proved that ‘rocket and feather’ pricing does exist. Had wholesale costs increased at the same rate the supermarkets would have passed these on at the pump straightaway just as they did in April and May this year.  “Unfortunately, other retailers that don’t buy wholesale fuel as frequently are just as guilty as they have now had plenty of time to cut their prices. They were, more than likely, waiting for the supermarkets to lead the way, but this surely isn’t a valid excuse. “So while there are times when fuel pricing in relation to wholesale prices does operate transparently, sadly October just wasn’t one of those months. “We strongly urge all retailers to lower their petrol prices in line with the reduced wholesale cost of unleaded. And, with the pound gaining strength against the dollar on 1 November, there will be even greater scope for a cut.” The lower wholesale price of petrol has been brought about by an 11% fall in the price of oil which has gone from $84.73 at the start of October to $75.55 at the close. Sterling – the other important factor in determining wholesale costs – lost 2% on the dollar, dropping from $1.30 to $1.27 in the month. Regional fuel price variation The North East had the cheapest petrol in the UK at the end of October at 129.25p a litre. The South East had the most expensive at 131.45p. It also had the dearest diesel at 137.72p. Northern Ireland had the lowest priced diesel at 135.55p. The North East, however, made up for having the lowest price petrol as it suffered the biggest diesel price increase at 2.71p taking a litre to 136.55p.

Pump prices continue to creep ever upward with unleaded increasing by 1.65p to 130.59p and diesel by 1.32p to 132.19p in the month. A year ago, however, petrol was 117.51p and diesel was 118.37p. Sadly, the combination of a weaker pound and an oil price of over $70 a barrel has sent prices shooting up. In the past year only the months of June, February and October have given drivers a little respite at the petrol pumps. And it was worse for diesel drivers with nine months of increases.   The average price of petrol in the UK is now at its highest since the end of July 2014 just before the price of a barrel of oil began to freefall and diesel is at its most expensive since the beginning of October the same year. The very important costly difference for every driver, however, is that back then oil was $106 a barrel and the pound was worth $1.70.  Now, in stark contrast, oil finished August at $77.54 while sterling was only worth $1.29 which means both petrol and diesel are far more expensive for retailers to buy on the wholesale market. So despite the lower oil price, the substantially weakened pound has caused fuel prices to reach their highest levels for the last four years.  There have been no significant reductions in the average cost of supermarket fuel since 24 June, meaning by the end of August prices had crept up by 3.38p for petrol (123.77p to 127.15p) and by 3.12p for diesel (127.23p to 130.35p). The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded is £71.82 – an increase of 91p on July and £7.32 dearer than a year ago. For diesel, the equivalent cost is £73.29 for a tank today – 73p more than last month and £8.19 more expensive than at the end of August 2017. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “August was another bad month for motorists and it’s rapidly becoming a horrible year on the UK’s forecourts and it looks like further increases are inevitable. Having benefitted from some very low prices two and a half years ago drivers get a nasty shock every time they go to fill up their cars, having to fork out more and more. “While it’s clearly a tough time for regular motorists unfortunately there is currently no end in sight to the rising cost of fuel. With the pound at such a low against the dollar, and fuel being traded in the US currency, it will only take a moderate rise in the price of oil for some eye-wateringly high prices to be seen at the pumps.  “With many factors at play on the global oil market the price of a barrel could easily break through the $80 mark and stay there. If this were to happen it would be dire news for drivers and we could even see pump prices heading towards the record highs of April 2012 when petrol hit an average of 142p a litre and diesel 148p.” Pricing – what has happened to UK pump prices since September 2017  Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices The North East and Scotland suffered the largest rise in the price of unleaded in August at 1.81p a litre. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest petrol at the start and end of the month, closing August at 129.38p but the East Midlands had the smallest a 1.45p a litre. In the South East unleaded was the most expensive across the UK at 131.46p.  Regional average diesel pump prices** Diesel went up the most in the North West and North East, increasing by around 1.48p a litre. Northern Ireland experienced the lowest increase at 99p as well having the cheapest diesel at 131.77p a litre.

Last month saw the continuation of recent ‘see-saw’ pump price changes – while drivers were stung with\xa0one of the worst petrol price rises through May 2018, the following month saw\xa0average prices fall by around 2p a litre. This began to be reversed in July meanwhile, with a litre of unleaded up by 1.08p (127.72p to 128.8p) in the month and diesel up by 1.03p (130.82p to 131.85p) Data shows that it was supermarkets that increased their prices the most in July, largely cancelling out the price cuts that they introduced just a few weeks earlier in June. The price of an average litre of supermarket unleaded was up 1.64p to 125.34p, while diesel was up 1.62p to 128.88p. Motorway service areas, which tend to charge to the most for fuel, increased the price of a litre of petrol by 1.19p to 146.09p, but left diesel almost unchanged at 148.14p. Across the UK, it now costs drivers on average £70.84 to fill up a 55-litre family-sized petrol car (up 59p on June), and £72.52 for a similar diesel model (up 57p on June). There is a high degree of volatility in wholesale fuel prices at the moment, as a result of the sharply fluctuating oil price which, after starting the month at just under $77 a barrel, fell to $70 on 17 July before recovering again to $74 by the end. A number of factors have contributed to the price changes – while\xa0OPEC’s announcement that its member countries will begin pumping more oil had the effect of pushing prices down, these are now being offset by both the ongoing tensions between the US and Iran over its nuclear deal, and with China over trade and the threat of tariffs which can force prices up. RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis said: “July saw a return to rising prices at the UK’s forecourts, following some price cuts in the previous month – the rollercoaster effect of rising and falling prices that drivers will have witnessed in recent months is certainly in full swing. “The volatility of the price of a barrel of oil, and in turn wholesale fuel prices, makes it difficult to determine where prices might go next. The announcement in June by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that its member countries would be increasing oil production could have been a trigger for further price falls, but the complicated disagreements between the United States – another big oil producer – and Iran and China are making prices go the other way. The result is a great deal of uncertainty on what might happen with UK fuel prices in the coming weeks. “Fortunately for UK drivers, the pound remained stable against the US dollar – which is important as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars. A weakening pound means it costs more for retailers to buy fuel in, which in turn tends to mean higher prices at the pumps. “What is certain however is how much more expensive it is to fill up a car this summer compared to last year. At the end of July 2018 it cost £7.50 (12%) more to fill a 55-litre unleaded fuel tank compared to the same point in 2017, and £8.77 (14%) more to fill an equivalent diesel.” ‘See-saw’ pricing – what has happened to UK pump prices since the start of the year  Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices** The largest increase in unleaded prices was in Scotland, although it is still on average more expensive to fill up in the South East of England compared to every other part of the UK.

RAC Fuel Watch data shows that petrol fell from 129.37p a litre across the UK to 127.59p after the supermarkets cut their prices in response to lower wholesale costs. Diesel also reduced but only by 1.5p a litre from 132.32p to 130.74p. As a result, it now costs £70.17 to fully top up an average 55-litre family car with petrol (nearly £1 (98p) a tank less than it did a month ago) and £71.91 for a similar car that runs on diesel (86p a tank less than a month ago). The greatest price reductions were seen across UK supermarkets, where an average of 2.4p came off the price of a litre of unleaded, and 2p off a litre of diesel. Drivers filling up at motorway services meanwhile saw no reduction at all in prices during June – with a litre of petrol remaining at 145p and diesel at 148p per litre.  The fall in the price of petrol and diesel occurred early on in June, with some of the largest fuel retailers responding to calls by the RAC to cut their prices in the wake of falling wholesale prices. Unfortunately however, wholesale prices started to creep up again at the very end of the month – snuffing out the possibility of petrol and diesel prices becoming any cheaper through the start of July. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The big fuel retailers finally bowed to pressure in early June by cutting the price of both petrol and diesel at the pumps – offering some respite to drivers who just a month earlier had experienced the largest jump in average forecourt prices since the RAC began tracking prices. “But while the price of oil slid back to around $72 a barrel in the middle of month, since this point it has been rising again – ending June nearer $76 a barrel and with wholesale fuel prices now also starting to rise again.  “So we remain in a period of real volatility when it comes to fuel prices. Late in June the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which represents some of the world’s largest oil producing nations, agreed to increase global oil production. While this would normally signal cheaper oil, and in turn cheaper fuel prices, other factors have been at play – namely an escalating trade dispute between the United States and other major countries and the prospect of renewed sanctions placed on another oil-producing nation, Iran. “At the same time, the pound remains comparatively weak against the US dollar, which reduces the buying power of UK fuel retailers. With fuel costing them more to buy in, this invariably means higher prices are passed on to drivers at the pumps. As a result, motorists sadly shouldn’t hold out much hope for cheaper fuel in time for the start of the school summer holidays.  “It has been reported that the Government is considering ending the fuel duty freeze. Aside from the fact that petrol and diesel in the UK are subject to some of the highest levels of taxation anywhere in Europe, it is also the case that the fuels are at their highest prices for more than three years. With a significantly weaker pound, it would only take a few further oil prices rises this year to see prices start to rocket.”  Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices** While London saw the largest drop in average petrol prices in June, it remains one of the most expensive places to fill up – second only to the South East of England. The North East is the cheapest place to buy the fuel. It is a similar picture when it comes to diesel: London saw the largest fall in average diesel prices but it stills costs more to fill up there than in most other parts of the UK, with Northern Ireland currently the  cheapest.

The May 2018 rise has made the cost of a tank of diesel for a family car £3.37 more expensive at £72.81.\r\n \r\n\tThe RAC Fuel Watch data also shows the average prices of both petrol and diesel have gone up every single day since 22 April, adding 8p a litre in the process – the longest sustained price increase since March 2015.\r\n \r\n\tIn May the big four supermarkets raised petrol by 5.49p a litre and diesel by 5.88p while on the motorway, service stations added 6.37p to unleaded, taking it to 144.75p a litre, and 6.69p to diesel making it an eye-watering 147.80p a litre – 15p a litre above average UK prices for both fuels.\r\n \r\n\tThe forecourt increases have been driven by a jump in the price of oil, coupled with a weakening of the pound against the dollar. Oil broke through the $80 a barrel mark twice in May – something which has not been seen for three and a half years (since 12 November 2014).\r\n \r\n\tOverall, May saw a 3% increase in the price of a barrel of oil (from $74.31 to $76.39) and a 2% drop in the value of the pound against the dollar ($1.35 to $1.33), making the wholesale price for retailers more expensive as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars.\r\n \n\n \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “May was a hellish month for motorists. Sadly, they have been besieged by pump price rises for three months with nearly 9p a litre being added to petrol since the beginning of March.\r\n \r\n\t“The rising oil price together with a weaker pound is a punitive combination for anyone that drives regularly. For many people there is little alternative to the car for the majority of journeys they have to make so it is therefore very difficult to avoid feeling the pinch of rising pump prices.\r\n \r\n\t“In the last week of May the oil price cooled a little to $76 a barrel which is slightly better news for motorists as the RAC’s two-week forecast is currently showing that average prices may even reduce by a penny or so. While this isn’t much, and could easily change in response to oil trading this week, it is at least a sign that the constant rise in forecourt prices may have stopped for the time being.\r\n \r\n\t“Looking at the bigger picture, there is talk that OPEC – the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – may agree at its meeting on 22 June in Vienna to change its tack of restricting oil supply. The group, together with Russia, have been limiting production with a view to removing the long-term oil glut. This strategy has been successful and, as intended, caused the barrel price to rise. If a decision is taken to increase supply it may provide some much-needed relief for motorists at the pumps in the UK.”\r\n \nRegional fuel price variation\n \r\n\tThe North West experienced the biggest rise in petrol prices with a litre going up 5.98p in May to 128.72p. Northern Ireland saw the smallest increase at 5.07p a litre, although unusually their unleaded was not the cheapest in the UK as that honour went instead to the North East with a litre costing 128.24p at the end of May. The South East once again was the most expensive place to buy petrol with a litre averaging 129.83p.\r\n \r\n\tLooking at diesel, drivers in Wales endured the greatest increase on the forecourt with a litre jumping by 6.07p to 132.03p. The North East and South East had the smallest rise at 5.66p, but a litre of diesel in the South East is the most expensive in the UK at 132.73p.\r\n \n\n \nRegional average unleaded pump prices**\n Notes to Editors * UK average fuel prices quoted in the RAC Fuel Watch May 2018 report are based on Experian Catalist data from 1 to 31 May 2018.

The price hikes have been driven by the rapidly rising cost of oil which yesterday hit $80 a barrel for the first time since mid-November 2014. And even more rises could be on the horizon as one oil chief has speculated that the barrel price could rise to $100 again – a price last seen in August 2014. If this were to happen pump prices could get close to the record levels seen in April 2012 when an average litre of unleaded was 142.48p and diesel was 147.93p. On Thursday (17 May 2018) the petrol price went up 126.62p a litre while diesel was even higher at 129.41p. The RAC’s two-week price prediction, however, has unleaded increasing to 128.5p and diesel to 131.5p. Should oil hit $100 a barrel, with the pound staying at its current low level against dollar of $1.35, we could unfortunately see petrol being sold for an average of 141p a litre and diesel for 144p.  This would make it £8 more expensive to fill up a 55-litre family car with petrol or diesel (petrol – £69.64 to £77.55; diesel – £71.18 to £79.20). This is a shocking £22 a tank more expensive for unleaded than in early 2016 and nearly £24 dearer for diesel. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Fuel prices are now at their highest since mid-October 2014 (16 October 2014) which means we are paying 25p more a litre than we were at the start of 2016 when oil crashed to $26 a barrel and the average price of both fuels was around 101p.  “And, sadly for motorists, and household budgets up and down the UK, the worst may be still yet to come. If the price of oil goes up towards $100 a barrel we will very likely see a return to the dark days of April 2012 when petrol and diesel hit record highs. Even though the oil price was higher then (around $120 a barrel) today’s weaker exchange rate will lead to similar prices at the pumps. “This will inevitably force families to make some tough choices about how they spend their money. We know from experience people cut back on longer social journeys in order to save money. It is also likely to have a negative effect on consumer spending as putting fuel in the car to get to work takes priority over shopping and eating out. “The oil price has increased by $30 a barrel since last July as a result of OPEC (the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and Russia limiting production to reduce an oversupplied market. On top of this we now the United States’ decision to re-impose economic sanctions on Iran which is the third biggest oil producer in OPEC. This will tighten supply even further and cause the barrel price to go up even more. The oil glut that made fuel prices so low two to three years ago is fast becoming a distant memory and the bad times of the high pump prices of 2012 may unfortunately be returning.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Diesel rose 2.94p a litre from 123.08p to 126.02p. \r\n\tNot since December 2016 have average fuel prices risen so sharply. The increase then was 3p a litre for both fuels, with petrol rising to 117.23p a litre and diesel to 119.63p. The last time the average price of unleaded was as expensive at it is now was in mid-November 2014. Diesel last exceeded 126p a litre on 1 December 2014. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “A 12% surge in the price of oil* from $67 a barrel to $75 has cost motorists dear in April. A 3p a litre rise at the pumps is fortunately fairly unusual, but it’s definitely bad news as it means drivers are now paying 8p more a litre than they did last summer. \r\n\t“The cost of filling up an average family-sized 55-litre car with petrol is now nearly £68 (£67.76) which is £4.50 more expensive than it was last July. For diesel car drivers it’s even worse with a tank costing over £69 (£69.31), which is £5.50 more. \r\n\t“The dramatic rise in the oil price and its knock-on effect on the cost of fuel is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the four big supermarkets, which sell the largest volumes and therefore buy fuel in more quickly than other retailers, have raised their prices even more steeply. A litre of supermarket petrol went up 3.2p to 120.17p, and diesel by 3.3p to 123p, signifying they are quickly passing on increased wholesale costs to motorists. \r\n\t“Unfortunately, the price of oil gained $8 in April driven by a combination of international issues, all of which could negatively affect global supply. The biggest of these is the fear that the United States could re-impose crippling economic sanctions on Iran – the third largest oil producer in OPEC – over its controversial nuclear energy programme which it has been limiting as agreed with six world powers, including the US and the UK. \r\n\t“The outlook for fuel prices is not good at the moment as the oil price is well over $70 a barrel, and if the US does try to re-impose sanctions on Iran and supply drops, motorists will end up paying far more at the pumps. Our current two-week prediction is for prices to go up by a penny or so, but this could quickly get worse if oil gets more expensive and the pound weakens any further.” \nRegional fuel price variation \n \r\n\tNorthern Ireland unusually experienced the biggest increase in petrol prices with a 3.47p rise from being the cheapest in the UK at 119.47p a litre to a ‘middle of the road’ 122.94p. The West Midlands saw the smallest increase at 2.38p to 122.68p. The South East is still the most expensive place to buy petrol with a litre costing 124.05p at the end of April. \r\n\tLooking at diesel prices, motorists in Scotland were subject to the biggest uplift – 3.16p – to 126.06p, which was only just worse than Northern Ireland, although drivers there can take some solace from the knowledge that they are buying the cheapest diesel in the UK at 125p a litre. The most expensive diesel can be found in the South East where a litre now costs 126.79p.  \nRegional average unleaded pump prices  \nRegional average diesel pump prices \r\n\tMotorway fuel prices were largely unchanged in April with a litre of petrol costing 138.43p (a rise of just 0.34p) and diesel 141.11p – a slightly larger rise of 1.13p.

This was in response to calls for cuts from the RAC (8 Feb &amp; 15 Feb) due to the falling price of both fuels on the wholesale market, which was itself triggered by a fall in the oil price. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude ended February 4% lower than at the start at $65.66 having dropped to a near three-month low of $61.46 in the middle of the month (13 February). The fall in the oil price was caused by both an unexpected increase in fuel stocks in the United States and the reopening of the major Forties oil pipeline in the North Sea which had been closed for unplanned maintenance – with it open again, nearly half a billion extra barrels of oil a day are made available to the market. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “After a succession of fuel price rises taking petrol to its highest level in three years in January, motorists finally saw a reversal of fortune in February as a result of a lower oil price which made some significant cuts at the pumps possible. “We commended the supermarkets for responding swiftly to our calls for pump price reductions, not least because we know what impact their pricing can have on other fuel retailers. But we do understand how much harder it can be for smaller retailers who don’t buy as frequently as the supermarkets to cut their prices as a result of sudden or short-term wholesale price changes. However, we are aware of some smaller retailers who pride themselves on having very low prices. “The question for drivers now, of course, is what happens to prices next. While the pound has weakened a little against the dollar – which is important as fuel is traded in dollars – the oil price remains around $65. This has created some downward pressure on wholesale petrol and diesel prices. Whether this means there is scope for another forecourt price cut in the next few weeks remains to be seen and is something we will monitor extremely closely.” It now costs on average £66.08 to fill the tank of a 55-litre family petrol car, or £67.57 if the car runs on diesel. The average price of filling up at a supermarket stands at £64.34 for petrol (116.98p per litre) and £65.75 for diesel (119.54p per litre). Regional fuel price variation While Wales recorded the largest drop in its average unleaded prices in February (down 2.65p through the month), the cheapest petrol was sold in the North East (119.08p per litre). The South East was once again the most expensive place to buy unleaded at 121.19p per litre. Northern Ireland remains the cheapest place to buy diesel at an average of 121.76p per litre, contrasting with the South East that remains the most expensive location to purchase the fuel (123.68p per litre). Scotland recorded the largest fall in diesel prices this month, a drop of 2.55p (122.86p per litre). February also saw a continuation of the phenomenon of supermarket-led ‘hyper local’ fuel price wars, where fuel is being sold at loss in a bid to win customers to their stores. For instance, in Taunton in Somerset three supermarkets have been trying to outdo each other to attract drivers, leading to prices as low as £108.7 for unleaded (Tuesday 6 March).

RAC Fuel Watch is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;January sees fuel prices rise for third month in row&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 31, 2018&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The national average price of petrol and diesel rose in January for the third month in a row, RAC Fuel Watch data reveals. Unleaded increased 1.34p at the pumps to 122.24p a litre while diesel went up 1.56p to 125.04p a litre. This means the price of petrol has increased 4p a litre since October 2017 when it was around 118p. Diesel has gone up 5p a litre, rising from around 120p in October to 125p. Petrol is now at its highest point since late November 2014 and diesel the highest since early December 2014. The average price charged by the big four supermarket fuel retailers suffered a bigger rise at 2p a litre, taking the average price of a litre of supermarket petrol to 119.76p and diesel to 122.45p. The retail fuel price rises have been sparked by a 2% increase in the price of oil, albeit somewhat softened by a more recent 5% boost in the value of the pound to $1.42 on 31 January. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The start of 2018 hasn’t been good for motorists as they’ve had to endure their third consecutive monthly increase at the pumps. Both petrol and diesel are now at their highest points for more than three years which is bound to be making a dent in household budgets.” Filling a 55-litre family car with petrol now costs £67.23 whereas the diesel equivalent is more expensive at £68.77. This is in stark contrast to the cheapest point of 2017 in July when a tank of unleaded was £4.35 cheaper and a diesel fill-up was £5.51 cheaper. Simon Williams added: “There is a glimmer of hope that some of the heat in the forecourt price of fuel could cool in February as our current two-week forecast shows reductions of a penny for petrol and two pence for diesel.  “Whether this will filter through at the pumps is questionable as retailers are generally loath to pass on wholesale savings when they consider them to be marginal.  “While the fuel market is very hard to predict at the best of times there is currently even greater uncertainty as the price of oil went through the $70 a barrel mark in January for the first time in more than three years while sterling has strengthened against the dollar making wholesale fuel cheaper as it’s traded in dollars.  “We urge fuel retailers to be fair to motorists and pass on the current savings in the wholesale price of petrol and diesel at the pump. Reflecting downward movement in wholesale prices on the forecourt, however small, is important for retailers as motorists generally believe there is little transparency in the price of fuel, unless of course costs are on the up when they understand all too well they will quickly be paying more to fill up.” Regional fuel price variation Scotland suffered the largest increase in the price of both unleaded and diesel. Petrol north of the border went up 1.76p a litre in January from 120.12p to 121.88p. The North East, however, had the smallest rise with only a penny being added to the price – 120.40p to 121.49p. By the close of January the West Midlands recorded the lowest average price of petrol at 121.49p, although Northern Ireland’s was almost identical at 121.50p. The South East was customarily the most expensive at 123.15p.  Scotland’s diesel increase was a whopping 2.34p a litre – 123.48p to 125.25p – considerably above the UK average rise of 1.56p. The West Midlands had the smallest hike at just over a penny a litre. The East of England, however, just took the South East’s title as the most expensive place in the UK to buy diesel with a litre averaging 125.73p there. Northern Ireland remains the cheapest for diesel with a litre costing 124.02p at the end of January after a 1.78p rise.

A litre of unleaded went up from 118.43p to 120.78p (2.35p) and diesel from 120.96p to 123.18p (2.22p) as a result of oil spending the whole month above the $60 a barrel mark. The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with petrol is now £66.43 – £3.55 more than in July when unleaded was at its cheapest point of 2017 at 114.33p. A tank of diesel now costs £67.75 – £1.22 more than October and £4.50 more than July when diesel was its 2017 low point of 115.02p. Compared to February 2016, however, when both fuels were an average of 102p a litre a petrol fill-up is £10 more expensive and the diesel equivalent is £11.65 dearer. The RAC Fuel Watch report for November also shows the price of petrol at the big four supermarkets increased by 2.37p a litre from 114.91p to 117.28p, but diesel rose less than it did across all retailers – 1.72p a litre compared to 2.22p – from 117.78p to 119.50p.  Pump prices have risen as a result of higher wholesale costs brought about by the increased price of oil. They have, however, been kept in check to some extent by the strengthening of the pound, which is important as fuel like oil is traded in dollars. The pound rose 2% from $1.32 at the start of November to $1.35 by the close. The end of the month also saw the OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meet in Vienna on 30 November to discuss the level of oil production among its 14 member nations. The organization has been restricting production together with some non-members, most notably Russia, with a view to propping up prices which fell to a low of $26 in January 2016 as part of its over-production strategy. The meeting concluded with the production cut being extended from its scheduled conclusion at the end of March to the close of 2018. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The market had been expecting OPEC to extend its production cut until the end of next year so after an initial rise in the price of oil during the day of the meeting, things cooled down.  “Even though the oil price is now consistently above $60 a barrel, the increased value of sterling against the dollar is helping to keep fuel prices down at the pumps. This is good news for motorists as it means petrol and diesel prices are unlikely to shoot up, in fact we may even see them come down very slightly in the next week or so.  “The price we will pay for fuel at the pump into 2018 very much hinges on how effective OPEC’s production cut continues to be in reducing the global glut of crude oil. The increased barrel price this is designed to create may also work against the group as it makes fracking for oil in the US more financially viable, which in turn may lead to America increasing its production and filling the gap from the cuts. If this happens it should mean forecourt prices won’t go shooting up.” Regional fuel price variation Yorkshire and the Humber endured the largest rise in unleaded pump prices with an average of 2.6p being added to a litre throughout November taking the price from 118.14p to 120.74. Scotland enjoyed the smallest increase – 1.9p a litre compared to the national average unleaded increase of 2.35p a litre, rising from 118.48p to 120.38p. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest petrol, finishing the month on 119.74p. Across the UK the price of diesel went up by an average of 2.22p a litre, but in the South West the figure was 2.46p with a litre going up from 121.04p to 123.50p. London and Scotland had the joint lowest increase at 1.91p a litre. The South East continued to have the most expensive diesel with a litre costing 123.77p at the end of November. By way of contrast the average UK diesel price was 123.18p a litre, and the Northern Ireland low price was 121.93p.

The price of a litre of petrol could rise by up to 4p per litre, which would take the average price of the fuel above 121p per litre – a price not seen since December 2014. RAC Fuel Watch data shows that this would also mean the average price of a litre of unleaded moves above that of diesel, something that has not been seen in the UK since early June 2016. RAC spokesman Pete Williams said: “The price of unleaded petrol will leapfrog diesel early next week, rising by up to 4p per litre as the impact of Storm Harvey and the shut-down of large refineries in the Gulf Coast drives up US demand for petrol imports. “The average price of a litre of unleaded on Thursday 31 August was 117.29p and diesel was 118.14p but we could see unleaded rise in the coming days to around 121p a litre, with diesel likely to stay stable around 118.5p. This will be the first time unleaded has been higher than diesel since June 2016 and we expect this to be the case for some time to come, or at least until the US oil industry is able to get refineries back into operation and production in the Gulf Coast returns to normal - to meet the United States’ immense appetite for gasoline. “One quarter of the refining capacity in the States remains offline leaving a shortfall of over four million barrels a day, and crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is down 13.5%. In response, oil traders are acting to redirect fuel to the US ahead of the busy Labor Day weekend surge in travel. “The price of a barrel of crude oil has also increased to $52.79 dollars following the catastrophic floods in Houston. Americans are wedded to their petrol engines and while they have been endeavouring to become more self-sufficient through increased fracking they are now having to buy more unleaded from overseas which is reducing the availability of unleaded for the rest of the world. “We have already seen the wholesale price of unleaded increase by 5p in just the last week and the ongoing crisis in the state of Texas could have a prolonged impact on demand and, in turn, the wholesale price – so we may see further price increases on UK forecourts.” Notes to Editors For all media\xa0enquiries,\xa0please contact the RAC\xa0press office team on +44 (0)1454 664 123.

A litre of unleaded now costs an average of 114.71p compared to 116.69p at the start of June. Diesel has fallen slightly more at 2.2p a litre from 117.77p to 115.57p. The average price at Britain’s four major supermarkets is 111.73p for petrol and 112.32p for diesel.  The average price of fuel is considerably lower than it was in February when a litre of unleaded was around 120p and diesel 122p. This means a tank of petrol is now around £3 cheaper (£2.91) than it was in February and diesel £3.54 cheaper. Compared to May a tank of unleaded for a typical 55-litre family car is now £1.09 cheaper at £63.09 and the equivalent diesel fill-up is £1.21 less at £63.56. The reductions are a result of a mid-month substantial drop in the oil price which saw a barrel go as low as $44.23 on 20 June. Across the month the oil price fell by 6% – starting June at $50.12 a barrel and finishing at $47.13 – which in turn caused the wholesale price of petrol to reduce by more than 3p a litre. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “June has been a good month for motorists, bringing a 2p reduction in pump prices, following on nicely from a similar drop in May. As wholesale prices have come down in response to a falling oil price retailers have done the right thing and passed their savings on to motorists on the forecourt.  “It has also been good to see retailers bringing the price of diesel in line with petrol as the wholesale price of diesel has been cheaper than petrol for some considerable time and right now they are broadly the same. “But while it’s definitely positive to see pump prices so much lower than they were at the start of the year – especially with the summer holidays just around the corner – the overriding message to motorists has to be one of caution as it seems unlikely that the oil price will stay this low for very long. “Oil producers group OPEC has been trying to shore up the oil price for months but the market is still oversupplied, mostly as a result of the United States’ increased production from fracking together with increased output from OPEC producers Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the organisation’s productions cuts.” Regional fuel price variation The North East saw the biggest fall in the price of unleaded with a litre coming down by 2.2p in June from 116.2p to 114p. Northern Ireland, however, started and finished the month with the cheapest fuel in the UK, with a litre now standing at 113.79p. The South East was once again the most expensive at 115.26p a litre. London saw the greatest drop in the price of diesel with a litre reducing by 2.49p. The North East recorded the lowest end of month price at 114.46p and the South East the dearest at 116.23p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;RAC presses retailers to cut fuel prices as oil price slumps&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jun 08, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The RAC is calling on retailers to cut the price of fuel after a sudden drop in the price of oil has brought wholesale costs down. Oil dipped well below the $50 a barrel mark last Friday and has stayed there since leading to a significant reduction in the wholesale price of both petrol and diesel. This gives the supermarkets the opportunity to reduce their prices due to the fact they buy fuel more frequently than other retailers and will be already benefitting from lower wholesale costs. Petrol could be cut by 2p a litre while diesel, which should already have been reduced due to previous wholesale savings, could be cut by around 4p a litre across the country.   RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “We have been monitoring supermarket fuel prices closely since the oil price began to tumble hoping that we would see them come down, but sadly that has not happened yet. In fact, one even increased prices by half a pence a litre.  “The cost of\xa0a barrel of oil fell to $47.15 on Wednesday – the lowest price since early May – contributing to a 2p a litre reduction in the wholesale price of petrol since 24 May. In the same time period the price of wholesale diesel has come down by more than 3.5p a litre. “The average price of unleaded at the four major supermarkets is currently 113.55p in contrast to the national average of 116.49p, but the drop in the price they buy their petrol in at ought to mean that comes down to nearer 111p a litre.  “Supermarket diesel is on average 114.33p a litre at the moment when it should also be around 110.5p a litre as the wholesale price is now lower than that of petrol. The UK average for diesel is 117.56p a litre which is at least 4p too high which suggests non-supermarket retailers are charging more for diesel than they should be.  “We sincerely hope the reason that retailers have not passed on savings in the wholesale price to motorists at the pumps this week is nothing to do with them thinking that people are distracted by the General Election.” The fall in the oil price has been brought about by the fact the United States has been found to have more oil and petrol supplies than expected which has demonstrated that production cuts from OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), in agreement with other major producers, are not having the desired effect of reducing the oversupplied oil market.

At the start of March a litre of unleaded cost 120.15p and diesel 122.19p, but the biggest fall in the price of a barrel of oil since last July ($3 – $55.31 on 1 March to $52.30 on 30 March) led the supermarkets to make two 2p-a-litre cuts in the course of the month, winding back prices to a similar level they started 2017 at and shaving £1.40p off a tank.  An average 55-litre family petrol car now costs £64.65 to fill up with diesel slightly higher at £65.75.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “March brought some much-needed spring cheer to motorists with a significant 2.5p a litre reduction in the average price at the pumps. While prices were static in February, the two months before that saw 5p a litre added, completing a year of rising average pump prices. March saw the biggest fall in the price of diesel since January 2016 and since November last year for petrol. “With longer days and the prospect of warmer weather many motorists will be making some longer journeys so lower fuel prices are very welcome but the big question is what will happen as we move towards the summer.  “Everything really hinges on the oil market and whether more is done to curb supply with a view to getting the price to rise. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with some non-members, have cut production, but their efforts have been undermined by the US ramping up its fracking production.  “The low oil price that gave rise to fuel being sold for under £1 a litre in January 2016 was all driven by OPEC over-producing to lower the oil price and stop US fracking activity but every week now more fracking rigs are coming online. This is no doubt causing a major headache for OPEC. It must decide whether to cut production further and allow the US to gain more market share as the oil price rises or reconsider returning to over producing and lowering the oil price to make fracking less financially viable and keeping its market share, albeit at a reduced price. “The strength of the pound against the dollar is also important as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars, but having suffered a big drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote the new norm seems to be a pound that is consistently worth $1.24. The absence of any further significant downward movement should mean fuel prices will be mostly decided by the oil market.” Regional fuel price variation Scotland enjoyed the biggest drop in the price of both petrol and diesel with a fall of 2.9p a litre, nicely ahead of the UK average of 2.6p. The North East has – for the second consecutive month – recorded the cheapest petrol and diesel prices in the UK with unleaded at an average of 116.50p and diesel at 118.53p at the end of March. The South East continues to sell the most expensive fuel in the land with a litre of petrol costing 118.38p and diesel 120.30p.

This is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel £11 more expensive than a year ago, but prices stabilise in February&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Mar 03, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;After two months of rises at the pumps, the price of petrol and diesel stabilised in February, according to\xa0RAC Fuel Watch\xa0data*. Unleaded finished the month at 120.23p a litre, a very slight increase on the figure of 120.05p seen on 1 February, and diesel at 122.25p, having started at 122.31p, meaning the country is still paying the most it has for fuel since December 2014. The stability has been brought about by the fact the two key price-determining factors – the price of oil and the sterling/dollar exchange rate – have both steadied, keeping wholesale prices in check. A barrel of oil averaged $55 throughout the month and the pound was worth on average $1.25. It now costs £66.13 to fill up an average 55-litre family car with petrol compared to £55.91 a year ago when the average price nationally was 101.65p. A tank of diesel is now £67.27 compared to £55.72 12 months ago when a litre averaged 101.31p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “While the price of oil has shot up by $10 since the end of November when many oil producing countries agreed to curb production it appears to have settled around the $55 mark which will be a relief to motorists who no doubt felt forecourt prices were constantly heading in the wrong direction. Filling up an average car is sadly now £11 more expensive than a year ago. The oil production cut, which is the first in eight years, is even more significant because it was brought about by the\xa0Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) making an agreement with 11 other oil producing countries to limit production by a total of 1.8m barrels a day globally with a view to getting the barrel price to increase.  Simon Williams added: “The agreement between OPEC and non-member countries seems to be holding firm for the time being which is not good news for motorists. For prices at the pumps to come down again we would need the oil price to reduce and the pound to make up some of its lost ground on the dollar.  “So a month where fuel prices have stayed broadly the same is welcome news. Given the global oil production situation and the weaker pound all we can really hope for at the moment is some continued price stability on the forecourt.”  Regional fuel price variation The North East took Northern Ireland’s title of having the cheapest fuel in the UK with petrol at an average of 119.34p and diesel at 121.19p at the end of February. The South East remains the most expensive place to buy fuel with a litre of petrol costing 120.94p and diesel 123p. The North West saw the biggest rise in the price of unleaded, albeit only 0.31p and the South East recorded the largest diesel price reduction even though it was just -0.18p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel rises 2p a litre in January to highest for more than two years&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Feb 03, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;But wholesale cost of fuel stays stable and indicates price cuts are needed Tank of petrol £9.53 more expensive than January 2016 The prices of petrol and diesel at the pumps increased by 2p a litre in January to their highest for more than two years* despite the wholesale cost of unleaded staying the same and diesel reducing, according to the first\xa0RAC Fuel Watch report of 2017**. The pump price rise unfortunately comes hot on the heels of a 3p a litre increase in December, making for a 5p a litre increase since the beginning of December. Aside from a fall in the price of forecourt fuel in November and July last year, the cost of petrol and diesel has been going up steadily since March. A litre of unleaded now stands at 120.01p and diesel at 122.30p – at the start of the year it was 117.90p and 120.35 respectively. At the beginning of August however, the average price paid by motorists for petrol was just 111.17p with diesel only slightly more expensive at 111.93p. And, compared to early January 2016 unleaded has gone up 17p a litre from 102.69p and diesel has increased 21p from its end of January 2016 low of 101.05p. The January pump price increase has added another pound to a tank of petrol or diesel, but sadly filling up a 55-litre family car with unleaded is now £9.53 more expensive and diesel £11.69 dearer than a year ago. However, the RAC believes motorists should be aggrieved by the 2p a litre January jump in price as the wholesale price of unleaded has remained stable throughout the month and diesel has actually reduced slightly.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “In the last two months 5p a litre has been added to the pump price of both petrol and diesel which means the cost of filling up is really starting to hurt motorists again. But the January rise is harder to swallow as there is a saving from wholesale prices that retailers should be passing on a little faster than they are.  “It is particularly worrying that the supermarkets have increased their prices by an average of 3p a litre in January with one adding nearly 5p a litre. “As the wholesale price stands currently we would be expecting to see average prices come down by over a penny a litre in the next fortnight.” The higher pump prices have been driven by a rise in the cost of oil and the lower value of the pound against the dollar. In January the average price of a barrel of oil was just over $54 and sterling exchange rate improved by 3%, helping to ease pump prices slightly as fuel is traded in dollars. Simon Williams added: “The oil production cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries together with non-OPEC countries have definitely led to a higher barrel price which in turn has translated to motorists paying more on the forecourt. But we are hopeful that the oil price will remain around the mid-$50 mark for some time meaning fuel prices should hover around the current level for some time, providing the exchange rate doesn’t worsen. “In the coming weeks we will be using RAC Fuel Watch to monitor prices very carefully with a view to ensuring prices do not rise quicker than they should, and we encourage retailers to pass on any savings should the wholesale price drop. We believe fuel pricing transparency is essential and are doing all we can to make sure that the retail price of petrol and diesel fairly reflect the wholesale cost.” Regional fuel price variation Northern Ireland once again has cheapest fuel in the UK despite suffering the biggest increases in both petrol and diesel in January with nearly 3p a litre being added in the month. The North East saw the smallest increase in unleaded at just under 2p a litre whereas Wales had the lowest diesel rise at just over 1.5p a litre.  The South East is still the most expensive region to buy both petrol or diesel with a litre of unleaded costing an average of 120.94p and diesel 123.26p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel prices rise and are at highest for 18 months&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 05, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;\nPetrol and diesel prices rose by around 3p a litre in December taking them to their highest average prices since July 2015. \nRAC Fuel Watch data for the last month of 2016* shows unleaded hit 117.23p a litre on 29 December and diesel 119.63p having been 114.24p and 116.56p a litre at the beginning of the month. \r\n\tThe wholesale cost of both fuels rose nearly 4p a litre as a result of oil production cuts announced by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries at the end of November. This led to oil rising 11.75% from $49.09 on 30 November to $54.86 on 30 December, with the price going back up through the $50 a barrel mark for the first time since late October. The price of oil is more than double what it was in January 2016 when a low of $26 a barrel was recorded. \r\n\tThe increased cost of fuel meant filling up an average 55-litre family car with petrol rose by £1.60 from £62.83 to £64.48 and for diesel from £64.11 to £65.80. In the course of 2016 unleaded went up 14.5p a litre from 102.99p at the beginning of January and diesel increased 13.64p from 105.99p a litre, although the diesel price went on to reach a low at the end of January of 101.05p, meaning motorists are now paying 18.5p more a litre now. \r\n\tConsequently, it now costs £8 more for a tank of petrol than it did at the same time last year and £10 more for diesel based on the end of January low price of 101.05p a litre. \r\n\tInterestingly, throughout December the average price of a litre of supermarket fuel increased more than it did among all retailers – 3.34p for petrol and 3.16p for diesel compared to 2.99p and 3.07p nationally. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The rising oil price is bad news for motorists as it caused a nasty jump in pump prices in the most expensive month of the year. \r\n\t“While forecourt prices rose by 3p a litre in December as the RAC predicted, they didn’t rocket as others had forecast. The big question now is how much further are they likely to go up, particularly in the long January wait to the next payday. \r\n\t“So far the price rises we’ve seen are purely down to the announcement at the end of November that OPEC and non-OPEC countries would be cutting oil production this month. Everything now depends on the strength of the deal and each country sticking to the agreed production levels. Russia will be of particular interest as it is currently producing at near record levels. \r\n\t“We are optimistic that prices will not increase by another 3p a litre in January based on what’s going on with oil and wholesale fuel now, but if in the months ahead the barrel price was to get nearer to $60 and the pound was to weaken further then that would be the worst possible combination for motorists. \r\n\t“Our current forecast for the next two weeks is for petrol to be around the 118p mark and for diesel to go up to around 121p a litre. We should also say that we need the pound not to lose any more value against the dollar as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars.” \nRegional fuel price variation \r\n\tBy the end of December Northern Ireland was the cheapest place to buy petrol, with the average price of a litre of unleaded selling for 115.58p, but it also saw the smallest increase in price through the month at 1.9p a litre. \r\n\tThe South East remained the most expensive region for both petrol and diesel, with the average litre of unleaded costing 117.84p, and diesel 120.28p, but Scotland saw the biggest jump in the petrol price at 3.75p a litre.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel prices down in November but rises on the cards&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Petrol and diesel prices fell for the first time in four months in November, the latest data from RAC Fuel Watch shows*, as retailers finally passed on wholesale savings thanks to a lower oil price – but the RAC is warning drivers to expect increases at the pumps before Christmas. The falls were as a result of a mid-month supermarket cut in prices which led to around 2p being taken off the price of both petrol and diesel nationally, and other retailers cut their prices too. By 30 November the average price of unleaded was down 2.89p to 113.96p per litre and diesel was down 2.4p to 116.37p per litre.  Unfortunately, these lower pump prices are likely to be short-lived. Motorists should expect price rises through December as a result of the\xa0cut in oil production announced on the last day of November by OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The market reacted instantly with the price of a physical barrel of Brent crude closing trading up 7% at $49.09 on 30 November and up a further $3.40on the first day of December to $52.49. And, sadly for motorists, this will almost certainly lead to further increases in the coming days and weeks. As things stand, the price of filling up a 55-litre family petrol car is currently at £62.68 (down from £64.27 at the start of November), while a similarly-sized diesel car costs £64 (down from £65.32 on 1 November).  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “While November was a good month for fuel prices with the first reduction for four months, it looks as though motorists are about to have an unwelcome early Christmas present in the form of higher prices at the pump. This is a big change from the last two Decembers when drivers benefited from falling fuel prices. “Given retailers were relatively slow to pass on wholesale price savings to motorists last month, despite the RAC’s calls for a cut, we will be monitoring closely to see if forecourt prices now rocket as a result of the recent leap in the price of oil. “The medium-term outlook for prices is, however, much harder to predict. OPEC has not cut supply for eight years and since mid-2014 has been actively operating an oversupply strategy to keep the barrel price low, to make it unviable for the United States to produce oil from fracking. This week’s production cut appears to be a move away from that and unusually is supported by Russia, which is not a member of OPEC. “What happens to the oil price in the next few weeks as the markets react will be crucial and could set the tone for what happens to prices early into 2017. If the US now responds by increasing its output, prices may not rise as sharply as some are predicting. It is also important to remember that the OPEC cut is currently only in force for six months. “Drivers should remember that while the oil price is the biggest variable affecting fuel prices, it is not the only one. With fuel traded in dollars, the dollar/sterling exchange rate also has a bearing on what retailers pay, and in turn what we pay when we fill up. A weaker pound, as we have seen since the EU vote, can see forecourt prices rise but a stronger pound can do the reverse. The unprecedented political situation on both sides of the Atlantic has the potential to buffet the exchange rate significantly through next year. “With the Chancellor rightly choosing to extend the freeze on fuel duty in last month’s Autumn Statement, with the rate remaining at 57.95p per litre, at least motorists won’t be hit with extra tax on fuel next year.”  Regional fuel price variation Wales was not only the cheapest place to buy petrol at the end of November, with the average price of a litre of unleaded selling for 113.12p, but it also enjoyed the biggest fall in price through the month (down 3.58p). The South East remained the most expensive region for both petrol and diesel, with the average litre of unleaded costing 114.56p, and diesel 116.88p. Northern Ireland was selling the cheapest diesel at 115.3p per litre, but it was East Anglia that recorded the sharpest drop in diesel prices, down 2.7p to 116.61p per litre.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;RAC calls for urgent pump price cut as wholesale costs fall&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Nov 11, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The RAC is calling on fuel retailers to cut prices at the pumps to reflect the falling wholesale prices of unleaded and diesel that have been triggered by a falling oil price and steadying pound. On 9 November 2016,\xa0RAC Fuel Watch data shows the average price of a litre of unleaded in the UK stood at 116.76p, with diesel at 118.64p. With wholesale prices down by around 4p in the last two and half weeks (25 October), the RAC believes there is now scope for a forecourt price cut of at least 3p per litre off both fuels, which would bring average petrol and diesel prices down to under 114p and 116p respectively.   The fall in wholesale prices means that the most price-competitive retailers including supermarkets and some independents could be selling petrol for around 110p a litre and diesel for 112.5p. Despite wholesale prices having been falling since 25 October the average price of both petrol and diesel have actually very slightly increased, by around a third of a penny. The ‘flash crash’ of the pound that occurred at the start of October, coupled with the oil price that rose through much of the month, has been pushing the price of petrol and diesel up. In fact,\xa0petrol rose more in October than in any month in the past three and a half years. But the more recent fall in the cost of oil and a slight recovery in the value of the pound is cancelling out some of October’s rises. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Fears are looming that OPEC’s planned production cut, due to be agreed at the end of November, won’t come to fruition and consequently won’t stem the over-production of oil that has kept prices low. The effect of that has been a short, sharp fall in the oil price, down from more than $50 a fortnight ago to around $43 now. This, combined with a rallying pound following last week’s High Court case on Brexit and the result of the US election, is causing wholesale prices to fall – which should be good news for motorists. “Consequently, we are now looking to retailers to cut their forecourt prices and save drivers money when they next fill up. We are very surprised retailers haven’t reduced their forecourt prices in the last week as they have a good recent record of passing on wholesale price savings at the pump. However, this current unwillingness to cut will not help their cause in getting motorists to believe that forecourt prices don’t go up like a rocket when wholesale prices rise and fall like a feather when they’re coming down. “A logical conclusion is that retailers are taking advantage of the current climate which has led people to think that higher fuel prices are an inevitability simply because of the weaker pound and talk of the rising cost of goods. A petrol and diesel cut by retailers now will send the right message to consumers that they can still benefit when wholesale fuel prices fall as they have done in recent days.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting\xa0rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;October sees biggest petrol price rise at UK forecourts in three and a half years&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Nov 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Unleaded prices now at highest since July 2015 Weak pound and a higher oil price biggest factors contributing to rise RAC calls for continued fuel duty freeze amid price uncertainty  The price of petrol rose more in October than at any time since February 2013, with diesel rising at the fastest rate since May 2008, data from the RAC’s latest Fuel Watch report shows.* A combination of a weak pound and Brexit fears since the UK’s EU referendum vote and rising oil prices have contributed to average petrol prices rising by 4.39p per litre from 112.34p on 2 October to 116.73p on 31 October. Diesel was up 5.17p per litre, ending the month at 118.65p on average, having begun the month at 113.48p. The average price of both fuels at the forecourt are now at their highest levels since July 2015 – 116.73p per litre for petrol and 118.65p for diesel.  But there are indications that pump prices might stabilise or even reduce slightly in November, as the cost of oil started to fall back in the last days of October. A barrel of Brent crude averaged just under $50 through the month but ended October at a one-month low of $46.63, down from its peak of $51.63 on Wednesday 19 October. Wholesale prices have also responded by dropping sharply at the very end of the month, down by almost 1p and 2p a litre for petrol and diesel respectively. It now costs £64.20 to fill an average-sized 55-litre petrol family car, with a similar diesel car costing £65.25 per tank to fill. For a light commercial diesel vehicle with an 80-litre tank, it now costs £94.92 to fill from empty. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “October 2016 was an historic month for UK pump prices but – sadly for motorists – for all the wrong reasons. The effects of the weak pound have really been felt on the wholesale market, and this, combined with an oil price at nearly double its lowest level in 2016, has put significant upward pressure on wholesale fuel prices. Retailers have had no choice but to reflect these dramatic increases in the prices they charge at the pumps. “Certainly, we are a long way from the remarkably low fuel prices enjoyed by families and businesses early in 2016, when the average price of unleaded was around 102p per litre and diesel was 101p. But while the pound remains in the doldrums, and with few expecting it to recover in the near future, there are some indications that November might not shape up so badly. “The biggest variable affecting what drivers pay when they fill up is the oil price. OPEC, which represents some of the world’s biggest oil producers, recently agreed in principle a cut in production. This would mark a move away from the over-production strategy that they have employed for so long, and mere talk of a cut has been enough to force oil prices higher. But a final deal is still to be agreed at an OPEC meeting at the end of this month and, with some analysts suggesting a deal might yet stall, this leaves open the prospect oil prices might stabilise or even fall before the end of the year.  “Certainly, if the Chancellor has been considering tinkering with fuel duty in this month’s Autumn Statement, the sheer volatility of prices we are currently seeing should, we hope, be enough to make him reconsider.” Regional fuel price variation The South East of England remains the most expensive place to buy petrol in the UK, with the average price standing at 117.18p per litre, while the East Anglia remains the most expensive region for diesel with the average litre on sale for 119.13p. Northern Ireland still sells the UK’s cheapest fuel, with the average price of unleaded at 115.45p per litre and diesel at 117.25p. However, Northern Ireland saw the sharpest rise in the price of unleaded in October (up 5.16p). Scotland saw the largest increase in the price of diesel, up 5.71p.

This is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel prices edge up in August despite early supermarket cut&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Sep 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The average price of both petrol and diesel sold on Britain’s forecourts edged up in August, despite a price cut at the start of the month, the latest data from RAC Fuel Watch indicates.* A litre of unleaded was sold for an average of 111.5p at the end of August, up 0.33p on the price at the start of the month. The average price of diesel meanwhile rose 0.77p, finishing the month not far off a 2016 high at 112.81p. While only slight increases, the effect cancelled out the fall in the average price of both fuels that took place in July. Following calls by the RAC for a cut in fuel prices to reflect softening wholesale prices, supermarkets took 2p off the price of a litre of both petrol and diesel on 1 August, forcing down average forecourt prices during the first week of the month. But since then average prices have started to creep back up – rising again by nearly 2p per litre from the end of the second week of the month. The increase in prices has been triggered by the rising price of a physical barrel of oil, up $6 (or 15%) in August and ending the month at $46.28, albeit down from the mid-month high of $49.78. The oil price is currently the biggest variable impacting fuel prices and the August increase contributed to a 3.11p rise in wholesale petrol prices and 4.81p rise in wholesale diesel prices. The average cost of filling up a family car with a 55 litre tank now stands at £61.33 for unleaded, and £62.05 for diesel. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “There was a strong case for a 3p per litre cut in the price of petrol and diesel in late July, and it was a relief to see retailers going some way towards passing on savings to motorists at the start of August. Since this point however, the oil price has rebounded slightly which has had the effect of pushing up wholesale fuel prices again. “Motorists have benefited from some slightly cheaper fuel prices in August compared to July, which will have come at a helpful time given the school holidays. “It is still the case however that the average price of unleaded petrol grew at its slowest rate in more than a year in August, and we are thankfully still a little way off the sorts of average prices we saw earlier in 2015 when petrol hit 117p per litre and diesel nearly 121p per litre. “There has been much speculation that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) might agree a curb on oil output, together with some non-OPEC members such as Russia, which could lead to price rises. But there has been this sort of speculation before and to date, no caps on production have been agreed and supply is still outpacing demand meaning the oil price has remained relatively low. It remains to be seen if, following a planned meeting in Algeria in late September, anything concrete is agreed which may give us a clearer idea of where oil prices, and therefore fuel prices, might be heading into the end of the year.” Regional fuel price variation The north of England saw the largest average petrol price rises in August, with a litre of petrol up 0.57p to 111.18p, while the sharpest diesel price rises were in Yorkshire and Humber (up 0.97p to 112.35p).  Northern Ireland was the only part of the UK that recorded a fall in average fuel prices in August, with a litre of unleaded down just 0.05p to 110.61p. The country also enjoys the lowest prices for both petrol (110.61p) and diesel (111.69p). The South East remains the most expensive region for fuel, with a litre of unleaded on average selling for 111.93p and diesel at 113.22p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;July brings an end to four months of rising fuel prices&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Aug 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;After four consecutive months of pump price rises, the average cost of petrol on Britain’s forecourts* has started to fall again, data from the RAC’s July Fuel Watch report shows. While the reduction in the price of unleaded is only small – 0.41p from 112.20p to 111.79p – it reverses the rising price trend which began in March. The average price of diesel also fell, but even more slightly (0.06p) from 112.47p to 112.41p. The fall in pump prices has been brought about by a reduction in the wholesale cost of both petrol and diesel. The price retailers pay for unleaded fell by 4.41p a litre and diesel by 4.67p in July, caused primarily by a $6.44 – or 11% – fall in the price of a physical barrel of oil, down from $48.07 on 1 July to $41.63 on 29 July.  What’s more, this reduction in the price of oil has meant the devaluation of sterling following the UK’s Brexit vote, which some had feared would lead to a price hike as fuel is traded in dollars, did not impact wholesale fuel costs negatively. Throughout July the value of the pound maintained an average of $1.31 against the dollar. The dramatic drop in the cost of wholesale fuel led the RAC to make a public plea to retailers on Thursday 28 July to cut their prices. On Monday 1 August this was acted upon by the major supermarkets, which together are responsible for selling around 40% of the UK’s fuel, with many knocking 2p a litre off both petrol and diesel prices.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “July’s slight reduction in fuel prices is very welcome as it has ended four months of rising prices on the forecourt. We are hopeful that the early August supermarket cut will make a bigger difference to household budgets in the summer holiday period even though it came a more than a week later than it should have done. “The falling price of fuel on the wholesale market is being driven by fears of slowing global economic growth adding to an existing oversupply of both crude oil and refined products such as petrol and diesel. Interestingly, this has happened at time when there are oil supply disruptions in Nigeria and Libya which had they not occurred would have meant there was even more oil on the world market. “As it is motorists continue to benefit from the lower oil price which had led to petrol prices that are nearly 5p a litre cheaper than a year ago and diesel that’s more than 3p a litre less expensive.” UK fuel price variation Across the UK, the East Midlands saw the biggest drop in average prices of both petrol and diesel; unleaded came down 1.53p a litre and diesel 0.95p. Northern Ireland’s petrol prices reduced the least, but its unleaded is still some of the cheapest in the UK, only more expensive than Yorkshire and Humber (110.54p v 110.37p).  Both Scotland and Northern Ireland unfortunately suffered very slight rises in the price of diesel (0.13p and 016p). Despite this Northern Ireland’s diesel is still the cheapest in the UK; Scotland’s however is among the most expensive. The South East remains the dearest place to buy fuel with average petrol prices in the region at 111.70p and diesel at 112.49p.

The oil price, currently the biggest factor determining UK fuel prices besides fuel duty, is now at its lowest level since early May – around $43 a barrel. As a result, wholesale costs including VAT – the price retailers buy fuel for – have been falling for nearly a month and currently stand at 103.65p for petrol and 104.32p for diesel. Despite this, pump prices have remained largely static during this time, at around 112p on average per litre and with some motorway services charging as much as 127p per litre. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “There is now a compelling case for an immediate price cut of 3p per litre off the price of both petrol and diesel at forecourts. That would take average prices down to around 109p per litre, and would see some of the most competitive retailers selling unleaded and diesel around 106p. “We would hope that retailers are not taking advantage of public perceptions that fuel prices would rise following the Brexit vote last month, as the wholesale market is clearly showing a downward trend in prices right now. Retailers have a reasonable recent record of passing cost savings on, and we would like to think the fact they have not yet done\xa0this is a blip rather than a new norm. “Another dip in the already low world oil price – driven by oversupply and concerns about the global economic outlook – is putting a lot of downward pressure on wholesale prices, and we believe retailers should now act by passing on the savings they are making to the UK’s motorists. “With millions of families currently away on holiday or soon to leave, combined with a boom in staycations this year, a cut now would be widely welcomed and would give motorists confidence that retailers are not keeping prices artificially high.”  Fuel prices have continued to rise since last winter when average unleaded prices hit a low of 101.27p per litre.

The price of oil is currently the biggest factor affecting the price UK drivers pay at the pumps, and a barrel of Brent crude oil ended both Monday and last Friday under $45 – the first time it has dropped to this point since early May. The falling oil price has had the effect of pushing down wholesale fuel prices, and to a large extent has cancelled out the impact of the declining value of sterling, RAC Fuel Watch data shows. Since the day it was announced Britain had voted to leave the European Union on 24 June, the wholesale price of unleaded including VAT has fallen 2.84p to 104.65p, yet the average price on forecourts has risen by 0.54p to 112.29p. The diesel price meanwhile has remained largely static, falling just 0.26p on wholesale markets to 106.42p, and rising 0.73p to 112.72p at the pumps. RAC spokesman Pete Williams said: “Despite some fears that petrol prices could shoot up as a result of the EU referendum, we believe there is now a strong case for a cut in the price of unleaded on UK forecourts. “The fact remains that the headline oil pricehas a huge bearing on what we pay for fuel at the pumps, and it is this price that has been falling as a result of relatively weak global demand and new fears of oil oversupply. “At a time when both consumer spending and the strength of the UK’s economy are under intense scrutiny in the wake of the EU referendum result, transparency in fuel pricing is crucial and we are therefore calling on retailers to do the right thing and pass on wholesale savings to drivers. “Two-thirds of cars on our roads run on petrol and a cut now ahead of the school holidays in less than a fortnight would be a welcome boost to families’ pockets. “We are also continuing to monitor the price of diesel closely to see if there is scope for a price cut in the weeks ahead.” A cut of 2p in the price of unleaded petrol would take the average price of a litre down to around 110p, or less than 108p per litre at the cheapest forecourts. Fuel prices have been increasing since the last winter when the average price for a litre of petrol hit a low of 101.27p.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Motorists hit by fourth straight month of fuel price rises&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jul 05, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;The average prices of petrol and\xa0diesel have increased for the fourth month running, according to\xa0RAC Fuel Watch\xa0data for June, but wholesale fuel prices have only risen very slightly as a result of the pound weakening after the UK voted to leave the EU. Unleaded went up 1.5p a litre (110.69p to 112.17p) and diesel by 1.66p (110.73p to 112.39p) in a month which saw oil rise from $48 to an early high of $50.73 and then fall to a mid-month low of $45.95 before finishing June on $48 again, coupled, of course, with the pound hitting a 31-year low against the dollar.  The impact of the 11% post-referendum fall in the value of the pound was softened by a simultaneous 6% drop in the oil price, meaning wholesale prices were largely unaffected. The pound ended the month 7% weaker – $1.43 to $1.34.  The forecourt price rise, which has seen unleaded go up more than 10p a litre from 101.91p at the start of March to 112.17p at the end of June, means the cost of filling an average petrol family car has increased by £5.64 to £61.69 in four months. The June pump price rise added 81p (£60.88 to £61.69) to the cost of a tank of petrol and 91p (£60.90 to £61.81) to a complete diesel fill-up. Diesel is now nearly 11p more expensive than at the beginning of March (101.56p to 112.39p), making a tank £5.96 dearer. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;June was another bad month for motorists with the price of petrol going up again. While it was only a penny and a half it makes for a rise of more than 10p since the start of March. Filling up with unleaded is now £5.64 more expensive which is enough to make an unpleasant dent in household budgets up and down the country, especially for those who have more than one car or need to fill up regularly. “But it is good news that fuel prices are so far weathering the Brexit storm; wholesale prices have remained relatively stable after an initial small upward jolt as a result of the pound falling on news of the referendum result. The fact the oil price dropped at the same time lessened the negative effect of the pound’s devaluation. We may well see pump prices rise slightly in July, but current indications are that this is unlikely to be the shock rise some were predicting. “The lower cost of a barrel of oil plays the greatest part in keeping forecourt prices down. It’s also worth remembering that compared to a year ago we are still paying around 5p less for petrol and nearly 8.5p less for diesel.  “While economists are saying the pound is unlikely to recover the ground it lost against the dollar so dramatically the day after the referendum, the oil price looks likely to stay around the $50 mark for some time due to OPEC’s continued over production strategy. There is also a hope that prices might even fall once various issues that have hindered production around the world are resolved.”   UK fuel price variation Across the UK, the South West and East Anglia saw the largest rises in average petrol prices at 1.7p a litre, while Scotland underwent the biggest diesel price increase at 1.76p. Scotland’s fortunes with unleaded though were far better, undergoing the smallest increase in the UK at just 1.23p a litre. The East Midlands saw the smallest diesel increase at 1.48p. Northern Ireland was still the cheapest place to buy both petrol and diesel in the UK with petrol at 110.99p and diesel at 110.64p. And, the South East kept its title of being the most expensive place to buy fuel with unleaded at an average of 112.70p and diesel at 113.05p.

Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;May sees price of petrol and diesel increase for third month in a row&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jun 04, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;Tank of petrol now £4.77 more expensive than at the end of February Price of oil rises by 14% adding another $6 to a barrel in May   The average prices of petrol and diesel have increased for the third month in a row making filling up an average family car around £5 more expensive than it was at the end of February. RAC Fuel Watch data for May reveals that the average unleaded pump price rose 2p a litre (1.92p) from 108.67p a litre to 110.59p, adding £1 to the cost of filling up a 55-litre family car in the course of the month (£59.77 to £60.82). This means that since the end of February the cost of a tank of petrol has risen by £4.77 (101.91p – £56.05 v 110.59p – £60.82). The average diesel forecourt price saw an even greater increase, going up by 2.2p a litre from 108.49p to 110.70p. This made the cost of a full tank of diesel £1.22 more expensive (£59.67 to £60.89), and a whopping £5.14 dearer than at the end of February\xa0(101.36p – £55.75 v 110.70p – £60.89). Average supermarket prices of petrol and diesel increased by 2% – 1.85p a litre for petrol (106.08p to 107.93p) and 1.68p for diesel (105.91p to 107.59p). Wholesale prices of both fuels have also gone up; petrol by 3.2p a litre and diesel by 4p a litre, predominantly as a result of the oil price continuing to rise. The spot – or physical – price of oil, so important in the wholesale fuel price, rose 14% in May, adding $6 to a barrel ($43.18 on 3 May to $49.26 on 31 May), and a barrel also reached its highest price since mid-October 2015 when it finished trading at $49.53 on Thursday 26 May.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;Motorists will be disappointed to see pump prices going up again having enjoyed filling up their vehicles with petrol and diesel for under £1 a litre at the start of the year. The sub-£1 litre is now sadly starting to seem like a distant memory. “Since the end of February the price of both unleaded and diesel have increased by around 9p a litre which has driven the cost of filling up by around £5. Now summer’s here what most families want is a period of stability so that making the most of the better weather doesn’t lose some of its shine through higher costs at the pump. “Much depends on the physical price of oil not rising any further. The oil price teetered around the $50 a barrel mark for the last few days of May having risen due to the extra demand from the start of the US summer driving season, but it has yet to go higher. Fortunately, some of the refinery issues which had led to lower than expected output have been resolved and we now have increased crude production in the Middle East. &quot;And, with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries deciding not to curtail production at its six-monthly meeting in Vienna on Thursday, there is good reason to expect the oil price will not go far above the current level for the time being, but predicting what will happen with oil is far from straightforward.” UK fuel price variation Across the UK, East Anglia saw the biggest increase in petrol prices with a 2.18p a litre rise, while the South East experienced the greatest diesel price hike at 2.31p. The North West underwent the smallest increases in both petrol and diesel, while Northern Ireland remains the cheapest place to buy fuel in the UK with petrol at 109.64p and diesel at 109p. The South East meanwhile has the most expensive fuel with unleaded at an average of 110.97p and diesel at 111.37p.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of petrol increases for second month in a row adding £1.45 to a fill-up&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;May 05, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;\r\n\tRAC Fuel Watch data for April shows motorists have suffered the second consecutive month of price rises at the pumps as a result of a 25% increase in the cost of a barrel of oil from $36.51 to $45.49 (1 &amp; 29 April), leading to the highest price since 10 November 2015 – $45.62 on 28 April. \r\n\tThe escalating oil price is the primary reason behind the forecourt increases with the average price of both petrol and diesel going up by more than 2p a litre to 108.27p (from 105.64p) and 108p (from 105.41p) respectively. The wholesale cost of petrol rose 2.5p whereas diesel increased by 4.6p a litre. \r\n\tThe petrol price rise has added another £1.45 to the cost of filling up a 55-litre family car (£58.10 to £59.55) on top of the £1.84 increased cost seen in March, making for a combined increase of £3.29p since 1 March. The cost of a tank of diesel rose by a similar amount in April – £1.42 (£57.98 to £59.40) on top of the £2 increase seen in March – making a two-month jump of £3.42 for a fill-up. \r\n\tSupermarket average prices rose by 3p a litre for both fuels with petrol rising from 102.68p per litre to 105.85p and diesel from 102.58p to 105.76p. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;The physical or spot price of Brent crude oil saw its largest one-month gain in price in the past 12 months. While this has had an adverse impact on the price motorists are paying for petrol and diesel on the forecourt, the world is still producing too much oil which means prices should not rise much further, and may stabilise or even start to fall again. \r\n\t“It’s worth remembering that while prices have gone up in both March and April motorists are still paying 7p per litre less for petrol and 11p per litre less for diesel than they were at this time a year ago which means a tank of unleaded is more than £3 cheaper and diesel is £6 less expensive. \r\n\t“The world oil market is currently in a very unusual situation. For some time\xa0OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – has been operating an overproduction strategy to keep prices low to stop the US producing oil from fracking, but April saw reduced production from Iraq and Nigeria due to supply disruptions and from the United Arab Emirates due to maintenance, which alongside a US fall in production, appears to have led to the oil price going up. \r\n\t“But, if the barrel price reaches $50 drilling would become a profitable option again for US shale producers and OPEC’s long-term efforts to maintain its market share would be undermined. For this reason it seems unlikely that the oil price will increase too much more.” \nUK fuel price variation \r\n\tAcross the UK, the South East saw the biggest increases with more than 3p a litre going on both the average prices of petrol and diesel – unleaded went from 105.48p to 108.89p and diesel from 105.52p to 108.9p. The East Midlands recorded the lowest petrol price rise of 2.77p a litre from 105.4p to 108.17p whereas the price of diesel in Northern Ireland was the lowest, only rising by 2.63p a litre from 104.02p to 106.65p. \n* Regional prices based on 31 March to 2 May 2016.

Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of petrol goes up 3p a litre in March signalling first rise since July 2015&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Apr 05, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;After eight months of falling pump prices RAC Fuel Watch data* reveals the average price of petrol suffered a sudden and unwelcome 3p a litre rise in March as oil went back above $40 a barrel for the first time since 4 December last year. The cost of a barrel of oil increased 8% from $35.91 on 3 March to $38.70 at month end causing the first upward shift in forecourt petrol prices since July 2015. At the start of March the average price of a litre of petrol was 101.91p but by the close it was 105.26p – an increase of more than 3p – which added £1.84 to the cost of filling up an average 55-litre car – £57.89. The wholesale price of petrol, including VAT, increased 6p a litre from 97.13p to 103.19p, suggesting that the pump price is likely to go up again in the coming weeks. Supermarket fuel prices, which are traditionally the lowest in the country, also went up. At the start of March, the average supermarket price of a litre of petrol was 99.88p but by month end a litre cost 102.19p – a rise of more than 2p. Worryingly, RAC Fuel Watch data for March shows diesel forecourt prices also increased by 3.7p a litre – 101.56p to 105.26p – even though the wholesale price only rose by 1.5p a litre (98.12p to 99.59p), adding £2 to the cost of a 55-litre tank. This indicates that retailers are once again either using the lower diesel wholesale cost to subsidise the price of petrol or using it as a means of increasing their profit margin. At supermarkets the average price of diesel rose equally dramatically – 3.5p a litre – from 98.57p to 102.09p.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: &quot;The good times for motorists enjoying lower fuel prices had to come to an end at some point, but unfortunately it’s happened with a bit more of a bump than motorists were probably expecting. With an important oil production meeting scheduled for mid-April, more bad news at the pumps may be on the horizon.” The price of a barrel of oil went up significantly in March, going over the $40-mark for four days in the middle of the month before dropping back to $38 by month end. While the world is still producing far more oil than it needs, a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to discuss limiting output is due to take place in Qatar on 17 April.  Simon Williams added: “An earlier meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC countries responsible for nearly 75% of the world’s oil production led to output being restricted to January levels. While this helped to revive oil prices, producers clearly still feel a further limit on production is needed. This is bad news for motorists as it will inevitably lead to more price rises on the forecourt. “We hope the rebound in pump prices will be limited by the fact that OPEC will not want to let the price go too far back up. Otherwise all their work aimed at safeguarding their market share will be undermined by oil production from fracking in the US being stepped back up again if oil goes back above $60 a barrel – the recognised point at which fracking becomes financially viable. For this reason, it looks as though we are heading towards a new norm of the oil price fluctuating between lower and upper limits of $35 and $55 a barrel.  “This means that motorists should hopefully not see the eye-watering prices they were paying at the pumps in April 2012 when the average price of petrol was 142p and diesel was close to 150p per litre. Motorists will also be relieved that the Chancellor saw sense and listened to the RAC and other campaigning groups by extending the freeze on fuel duty in his Budget.”   UK fuel price variation Around the UK, Wales saw the biggest increase in average petrol prices – 3.7p – from 101.4p to 105.1p. Average diesel prices went up most in East Anglia – 3.88p – from 101.49p to 105.37p.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&#x27;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;February sees price of petrol fall for eighth straight month&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Mar 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Average price of diesel remains static after January’s 5p fall The average price of petrol fell slightly in February, marking eight consecutive months of falls, RAC Fuel Watch data reveals. Motorists have now enjoyed eight months of falling unleaded prices from the beginning of July 2015 when the average price of a litre was 117p. At the end of February, the average price of petrol at forecourts was 101.93p – a drop of 15p and a saving of £8.25 on filling up an average 55-litre family car. February saw a small fall of 0.16p in the price of unleaded at the pumps. The wholesale price of petrol also finished the month 2p a litre cheaper than at the start due to increased petrol production, which should help to keep pump prices at their current level in the short term, or possibly even reduce them very slightly in March. The RAC Fuel Watch February report also shows that the price of diesel at the pumps remains largely static, rising from 101.11p to 101.18p, despite a 2.5p rise in its wholesale price. While this is a turnaround from January which saw a 5p reduction, the average price of diesel is still nearly a penny cheaper than that of petrol (diesel – 101.18p v petrol 101.93p). The average forecourt price of diesel has been lower than petrol since 25 January 2016 but is likely to switch back again in March. Average supermarket prices of both petrol and diesel hardly changed in February: petrol started the month at 99.88p and finished at 99.86p whereas diesel rose marginally: 97.96p to 98.24p. Both the oil price and the exchange rate – the two factors which have the greatest effect on fuel prices aside from tax – were the subject of much attention in February. The pound lost ground against the dollar throughout the month, falling from $1.44 on 1 February to $1.39 by the end, while oil underwent a late price surge to finish at $35.80 having started the month at $32.75.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Forecourt prices of both petrol and diesel have remained remarkably stable in February despite the pound losing 3% of its value against the dollar and talk of an oil production cut. The oil price had been consistently around $30 for most of the month but in the last few days of February rose to around $36 – a price we haven’t seen since the beginning of the year.  “Motorists are still benefiting from low prices at the pumps, with the supermarkets having held their petrol prices under £1 a litre thanks to a depressed wholesale price. In fact the wholesale price of petrol has fallen due to refineries scaling down heating oil production and switching instead to producing more unleaded, together with the US refining more petrol as it gears up for the American driving season which starts in May. This tends to have the temporary short-term effect of reducing the wholesale price, but this may change as demand for petrol picks up in the States. “While the average pump price of diesel has been cheaper than petrol since the end of January (25 January 2016) this may not last much longer due the increase in petrol production and its lower wholesale price. But the additional supply of diesel on the wholesale market brought about by greater refinery capacity in Saudi Arabia and India should mean prices remain comparatively stable for diesel motorists at the pump. “If it proves to be the case that oil prices have bottomed out, the RAC will be monitoring the effect on pump prices even more closely for any sign of the infamous ‘rocket and feather effect’ where prices go up far faster than they came down.” Is a fuel duty rise looming on the horizon? Simon Williams added: “Putting the oil price and the exchange rate to one side, motorists will be concerned as to whether the Chancellor decides to tinker with fuel duty in the upcoming Budget on 16 March. Throughout the last parliament he chose to maintain an even keel by freezing duty at 57.95p a litre after his penny a litre cut in the 2011 Budget, but we fear he may now seek to take advantage of low oil prices to increase it.  “Both independent modelling and the Treasury’s own analysis have demonstrated that an increase in fuel duty has a negative impact on economic growth and therefore we vehemently oppose any rise in fuel duty because the country would the pay the price for this in the longer term. “Motorists will be unforgiving of the Chancellor should he seek to squeeze more tax out of them when they are already amongst the highest taxed on fuel in Europe.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

This is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of fuel may have reached low point for now, warns the RAC&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Feb 03, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Motorists should make the most of petrol being under £1 while it lasts as data from the RAC Fuel Watch January report suggests the cheap fuel market may have bottomed out. Since oil reached a 12-year low of $26 on Wednesday 20 January ($25.73 – 27 August 2003) the barrel price has rebounded, finishing the month at $33.12, only $3 below where it started at $36.54. This has caused the wholesale cost of both petrol and diesel to rise again, although diesel still remains 3p a litre cheaper than unleaded. January was nonetheless a landmark month for diesel with 5p a litre coming off the average pump price as a result of the supermarkets first cutting to 99.9p a litre and later to below 98p. This led to an average petrol-diesel price flip on Monday 25 January with diesel becoming cheaper than unleaded (101.18p diesel v 101.86p petrol) – the second time in six months, the previous time being 29 July 2015 which lasted for nearly two months.  At the start of the year an average litre of diesel cost UK motorists 105.99p, but by the close of January this had fallen to 101.05p; in contrast petrol only fell from 102.69p to 102.01p, albeit its seventh consecutive monthly drop. As a result of the average 5p a litre diesel price reduction, the cost of filling a 55-litre family car came down by £2.72 to £55.58. While this impressive monthly reduction is causing the average price of diesel to move ever closer to the £1 milestone, early signs of an oil price recovery may prevent this happening.  At the end of November, the RAC signalled that drops in the wholesale price of diesel suggested an opportunity for a significant drop in retail diesel prices and supermarkets reacted particularly positively to the situation and dropped their average prices by 6.5p from 104.41p at the start of the month to 97.96p by the close. There was no change with supermarket unleaded prices – staying at an average of 99.87p throughout January. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Motorists have seen petrol and diesel prices reach their lowest points since 2009. January saw the oil price go into free fall with talk of a barrel dropping to $20 and possibly even to $10, but since the low of $26 a barrel the market has started to creep back up. If this continues for a sustained period, wholesale costs will rise further which will in turn lead to pump price increases. “However, the oil market is notoriously volatile, even in more stable economic times, so it’s still possible that the price could drop back again. And, even if there is a rise in the oil price, it seems unlikely that it will be drastic as OPEC seems set to continue producing more oil than is demanded to retain its market share. While there has been talk of a production cut, the market has yet to see evidence of this. “The other factor which is not helping the situation from a motorist’s perspective is the fact that the pound has weakened significantly against the dollar from $1.47 at the beginning of January to $1.42 by the end. This has undermined some of the benefit of the falling oil price and, with oil traded in dollars, this could prove to be even more harmful if the pound continues to lose value against the dollar while the oil price goes up.” HM Revenue and Customs data for December 2015 shows combined sales of petrol and diesel were 1.8% down on November at 3.938bn litres but 0.4% up on December 2014. More petrol was used in December 2015 than in the previous month – 1.458bn litres compared to 1.437bn; this was also a 0.8% increase on December 2014. Diesel usage, however, fell month on month by 3.7% from 2.574bn litres in November to 2.480bn in December, but was unchanged year on year. Sales of both petrol and diesel in December netted the Treasury £2.282bn in fuel duty revenue.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel prices may go as low as 86p a litre if oil price continues to fall&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 14, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Price of a litre of fuel may become cheaper than some bottled waterBut thousands still missing out on cheaper prices depending where they live The freefalling price of a barrel oil may lead to forecourt petrol and diesel prices going as low as 86p a litre at the cheapest fuel retail sites, the RAC says – but warns thousands of motorists are still missing out on cheaper prices. If a barrel of oil falls to $20, pump prices should come down to around 90p a litre at supermarkets and other cheap fuel forecourts, but a further fall to the $10 mark,\xa0as some analysts are now predicting, could pave the way for petrol and diesel to reach as low as 86p a litre. This would, however, depend on the pound not weakening further against the dollar. Since the beginning of December oil has tumbled by 30% from $43.26 to a 12-year low of $30.06 on Monday 11 January, but unfortunately wholesale fuel prices have not reduced as much as they could have due to the pound weakening against the dollar by 4.5% over the same period.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “With no apparent end in sight to the freefalling price of oil, motorists can expect some really low fuel prices in 2016. Breaking through the pound a litre price point for both petrol and diesel was clearly a welcome landmark, but it looks as though there is more to come. In fact we may get to a bizarre time when a litre of fuel is cheaper than a litre of some bottled waters. “At the moment, however, we have a situation where retailers still need to pass on more wholesale price savings on diesel to motorists at the pump, as the wholesale price is still 3p a litre cheaper than that of petrol. We should really be seeing diesel priced several pence cheaper than petrol on every forecourt, to the point where the average price of diesel goes below that of petrol. In many areas of the UK the price of fuel is sadly far higher than it should be: we would urge every fuel retailer to price fuel on their forecourts so that it more fairly reflects wholesale prices. “There is, however, a limit to how low prices can go as tax – fuel duty at 57.95p a litre and VAT on the total price, including fuel duty – make up the lion’s share of the price of a litre. Even if the fuel was given away and the retailers didn’t take a margin, the price of a litre would still be 70p.  “Every motorist should know that the tax-take at £1 a litre is 75%, and at 86p a litre it rises to a staggering 84%. Strangely, this means that VAT alone would be 14p, which would be more than the cost of the fuel and the retailer’s margin. Sadly,\xa0the Chancellor looks likely to put duty up in the Budget in March for the first time since January 2011. We would urge him not to use lower fuel prices as an opportunity to extract even more tax from the motorist at the pumps.” Currently,\xa0the average price of petrol is 102.5p and diesel is 103.21p: a reflection of the sub-£1 a litre fuel on supermarket forecourts as well as many other price-competitive retailers. However, RAC Fuel Watch data – which monitors the same information that retailers use – shows there is scope for a 5p reduction in the average forecourt price of diesel. Simon Williams added: “Unfortunately, even though our Fuel Watch data predicts a large reduction in average diesel pump prices experience from the last month tells us that retailers are simply not passing on as much of the savings at the forecourt as they should. They have been using the savings in the wholesale cost of diesel to subsidise petrol prices, but for the sake of transparent fuel retailing, this needs to change and motorists should see another cut in the price of diesel. “If retailers were to reduce the diesel price in line with the wholesale cost we should see the average price get very close to the £1 mark. “We are concerned that too few drivers are benefitting from these incredibly low oil prices as many less competitive retailers are still selling fuel at far nearer to £1.10 a litre than £1.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Price of petrol falls for sixth month in a row with the gift of sub-£1 a litre&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 06, 2016&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Average price of unleaded falls by 4p a litre in December saving £2 a fill-up Diesel reduces 3p a litre saving motorists £2.56 a tank Price of oil falls 17% prompting retail price cutting The average price of petrol fell by more than 4p a litre in December – from 107.55p at the start to 102.89p by the close, reducing the cost of filling up a family-sized 55-litre car for the sixth consecutive month – a saving of £2.02 on every tank. In the month where drivers were once again treated to the widespread sight of petrol being sold for under £1 a litre, RAC Fuel Watch data for December shows the month-end unleaded average price of 102.89p was the lowest since December 2009 and led to a tank of petrol costing £5.35 less than at the end of 2014.  The average price of diesel also dropped 3p a litre during the month – from 109.86p to 106.18p – cutting the cost of filling a typical tank by £2.56 and making it £6.91 cheaper than at the end of December 2014. The falling price of diesel may also have contributed to a new record sales high with Government statistics for November showing the UK used 2.574bn litres of diesel, which is more than at any point since 1990.   RAC Fuel Watch – which monitors the same data that retailers use – reports that December saw drops in the wholesale price of both petrol and diesel of 2% and 3% respectively, with the wholesale price of diesel falling for the fourth consecutive month. These reductions were fuelled by the falling oil price which underwent a 17% drop, with a barrel of oil coming down from $43.26 to $35.75 by the end of the month, taking it to a price last seen in June 2004. The barrel price tumbled to below $40 on Monday 7th December, paving the way for the sub-£1 litre, and has stayed below ever since. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “December was an excellent month for petrol car drivers with all four major supermarkets cutting the price of petrol to under £1 a litre on 11 December shortly after the RAC predicted it would happen. Unfortunately, despite the wholesale price of diesel being on average 2p a litre cheaper than that of petrol since 8 December, we didn’t see the pump price fall to the same level until a few days ago.  “It looks very much as though the supermarkets will have attracted extra customers into their stores before Christmas with the headline-grabbing price of 99.9p a litre for petrol but have cleverly made up for any lost profit by taking a bigger margin on diesel sales by not passing on the savings in wholesale price to motorists on the forecourt. “Supermarkets play a very important role in the fuel market as, despite only having 16% of all forecourt sites, they are responsible for 44% of the volume of all fuel sales. This means their prices affect what other nearby retailers charge as well as being highly influential on the nationwide average prices of both petrol and diesel. “Retailers have established a pretty good track record of passing on wholesale cost-savings at the pump over the period since the price of oil fell from $115 a barrel in June 2014. But not cutting the price of diesel when there was an opportunity to do so before Christmas has undermined that. While we still expect fuel prices to stay low for some time, it will be interesting to see how quickly pump prices go up again when the cost of oil rises. Of course, this tends to happen with little publicity in contrast to the fanfare that accompanies price reductions. “For average prices of both petrol and diesel to reach the £1 a litre mark, it would require a further drop in the wholesale price of petrol to be passed on by retailers, and for diesel pump prices to more closely reflect the recent reductions seen on the wholesale market. If retail pricing more directly mirrored wholesale movements then the average price of diesel should move nearer £1 a litre, but sadly unleaded may rise due to the weakening pound.” HMRC oil duty statistics for November* show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 2.7% up on October at 4.011bn litres and 0.3% up on the previous November. Petrol sales were down 1.6% (1.437bn litres) on October and down 4.1% compared to November 2014. Diesel, however, saw the highest number of litres sold in any month since 1990 with 2.574bn. This was 5.3% up on the month before and 2.9% up on November 2014.  Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

This is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Supermarkets should lead the way by selling diesel for under £1 a litre&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 16, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;With petrol being sold all over the country for under £1 a litre as a result of retailers passing on wholesale cost-savings, the RAC is now urging the supermarkets to, as a minimum, drop the price of diesel to match the price of petrol. As the wholesale price of diesel is now 3p\xa0a litre cheaper than unleaded, the RAC believes the major supermarkets – which lead the market on forecourt fuel prices – are in danger of being seen to take the country’s 11m diesel car drivers and Britain’s 3m-plus ‘white van’ men for a ride as there is no reason diesel should be priced higher than petrol. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Simon Williams said: “We hope the initial tight margins involved in selling petrol for under £1 haven’t led retailers to try to make up their lost profit by pricing diesel higher than it should be.  “Even though we saw the price of diesel drop below that of petrol on many forecourts a few months ago, there must be a temptation for retailers to maintain the differential and take advantage of motorists who have – over a period of years – become used to paying more for diesel than unleaded at the pump.  “As a result of two new refineries in Saudi Arabia coming on-stream, wholesale diesel is more widely available than ever before which means the price should be far cheaper going forward than in previous years. This, coupled with an oil price that has been below $40 a barrel for the last week, and still appears to be falling, should make it possible for diesel to be sold for under £1 a litre by the vast majority of retailers.” RAC Fuel Watch, which monitors the same data as retailers use to inform their buying decisions, reports that the wholesale price of diesel was below that of petrol all last week and was at a similar level to petrol the week before. While the wholesale price of diesel is currently 3p lower per litre than petrol, the average price at the pump was 3p more expensive at 107.72p on Monday 14th December compared to petrol at 104.37 which dropped almost 2p since Friday as a result of the sub-£1 litre.  Simon Williams added: “After breaking through the $40 mark, the price of a barrel of Brent Crude has continued to drop and stood at $36.81 when the markets closed on Monday, a price last seen in December 2008. Similarly, the pound has made up some of the ground it lost on the dollar in the last fortnight so wholesale prices are continuing to stay low, and in the case of diesel has fallen. This means we should see petrol stay around £1 a litre for a while, with diesel joining it if retailers are fair to motorists and pass on the savings.  “Our Fuel Watch data shows the average price of diesel should come down by about 6p to around £1 from its current average price which indicates that the wholesale cost-savings haven’t been passed on quickly enough.” While traditionally the focus of attention is on the headline price of unleaded due to the country having around 19m petrol cars, in reality total diesel sales are over 60% greater than petrol. Every day in the UK on average 74m litres of diesel are sold compared to 46m litres of petrol*. The RAC says the long-term outlook is for the oil price to stay low. OPEC is not due to meet again until June 2016 so unless an extraordinary meeting is called, there is good reason to believe production will continue to outpace demand and in turn keep wholesale fuel prices low.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol to fall to £1 a litre for Christmas as oil goes below $40&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 09, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Motorists will be treated to petrol at £1 a litre or under in time for Christmas if retailers ‘do the right thing’ and pass on savings in the wholesale price brought about by oil falling below $40 a barrel for the first time since February 2009. Britain’s supermarkets and cheapest fuel retailers will give motorists an early Christmas present in the next week, making it cheaper to visit family and friends at the most expensive time of year. And, the even better news is the sight of £1 a litre should become commonplace. RAC Fuel Watch data shows oil slipped even further following OPEC’s meeting in Vienna on Friday where delegates dismissed cutting production to stabilise the price. The end of day price for a barrel of Brent crude fell from $41.80 last Friday to $39.77 on Monday. This led to significant reductions in the wholesale price of both unleaded and diesel which the RAC believes will lead to a cut of 3p a litre in the average price of petrol and 5p a litre off diesel, taking average prices to around 103p for petrol and 104p for diesel. Diesel is already at a six-year low, with the average price reaching 109.18p on Friday. At these prices motorists would be saving around £9 on tank of petrol for an average 55-litre family car compared to this time last year, and more than £11 for a tank of diesel. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Simon Williams said: “With the price of wholesale unleaded dropping due to oil falling below $40 the climate is right for £1 a litre petrol, all we need is for the supermarkets to do the right thing and embrace the season of goodwill by passing on those savings at the pump to make Christmas that bit cheaper for everyone. “Motorists have already enjoyed petrol at under £1 as one supermarket cut prices at its 277 nationwide forecourts as part of a three-day promotion at the end of November, but this should now become a common sight across the country. If retailers don’t pass on the savings quickly, they will be giving themselves an unpopular Christmas boost to profits by pocketing the extra margin when they should really be passing this on to their customers instead. “The long-term outlook is for the oil price to stay low. OPEC is not due to meet again until June 2016 so unless an extraordinary meeting is called, it is anticipated production will continue to outpace demand and in turn keep wholesale fuel prices low.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before.  Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;A landmark fuel month: diesel drops to lowest price in six years and petrol drops for fifth month in a row&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Dec 03, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;November was a landmark month for the UK fuel market with both the lowest average pump price for diesel in six years as oil tumbled to $40.40 – the lowest barrel price since February 2009 – and the first widespread sight of petrol being sold for under £1 a litre again. RAC Fuel Watch data for November also showed the average price of petrol reduced for the fifth month in a row from 107.67p at the start to 106.98p as well as hitting a nine-month low on 11 November at 106.92p. Diesel, however, reduced to its lowest average price since late December 2009 when it reached 109.48p a litre on 30 November, having started the month at 109.77p. This means since this time last year the cost of filling up a 55-litre family car with petrol has plunged by £7.75 and a tank of diesel has come down even more, with a fill-up now £8.95 cheaper than a year ago. The RAC’s prediction of petrol being sold for under £1 also came true with one leading supermarket reacting to the falling oil price and cheaper wholesale fuel by treating customers at its 277 nationwide forecourts to a three-day promotion of petrol at 99.7p a litre. Another linked a £40 in-store spend to a 7p-a-litre forecourt discount taking petrol below the £1 mark. The RAC Fuel Watch report shows a barrel of crude oil fell over $3 in November, coming down from $47.32 to $44.03, with the six-year low of $40.40 being seen on 16 November. Unfortunately, the pound lost a little ground to the dollar – with a pound worth $1.54 at the start of the month and $1.51 at the end – undoing some of the positive effect of the lower oil price as oil is traded in dollars. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Simon Williams said: “In the expensive run-up to Christmas, drivers of both petrol and diesel vehicles are benefitting from far cheaper fill-ups than they did at this time last year. While petrol for under a pound a litre has become a reality at the cheapest retailers we would like to see this happen on a non-promotional basis. This depends, of course, on the cost of a barrel of oil staying low and ideally trading down a little closer to $40 for longer – something which is very hard to predict, particularly as OPEC meet tomorrow (4 December) in Vienna to discuss oil production strategy. “There has been talk of stabilising the barrel price which would mean stemming production, but it’s difficult to see how that would work when Iran begins to pump up to one million barrels a day in 2016, following on from its landmark nuclear agreement with the West. “The lower forecourt prices we’re enjoying at the moment are a product of the fall in world crude oil prices, which began in September 2014. After a six-year low of $45 a barrel in early February and two instances of going back up to the $60 level twice briefly since, the price has been consistently below $50 since mid-October, reaching a new six-year low in mid-November. “As it stands we anticipate a very slight average petrol price reduction in the next two weeks and another 2p a litre coming off diesel, taking the new six-year average low price even lower.” HMRC oil duty statistics for October* show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 1.9% up on September at 3.905bn litres and up 1.8% on the previous October. Petrol sales (1.461bn litres) were static on September whereas October saw the fifth highest number of litres sold in any month since 1990 with 2.444bn. This was 2.9% up on the month before and 3.7% up on October 2014.  Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Petrol and diesel price cuts expected as oil hits $40 a barrel&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Nov 18, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The price of a barrel of oil fell to $40.40 – its lowest price since February 2009 – on Monday, paving the way for another round of pump cuts and making the sight of £1 a litre at the cheapest forecourts ever more likely. RAC Fuel Watch data shows Brent crude dropped nearly $2 a barrel from Friday and $5 from a week ago, pushing down wholesale petrol and diesel prices and signalling expected pump reductions of around 2p a litre in the next fortnight.  The average price of petrol, which has fallen for the last four months, currently stands at 108.01p whereas diesel is at 110.24p, still close to the September price of 109.76p which was its lowest since December 2009. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Events in Paris made oil traders react on Monday causing a sudden dip in the price of Brent crude to the $40 mark which has not been seen for more than six years. With oil prices already consistently low as a result of too much supply, the dip – even though it will be temporary – should still be reflected in wholesale prices, making fuel cheaper for motorists.  “We hope retailers will be quick to pass on these new wholesale fuel savings at the pumps to make the cost of litre cheaper still. A barrel of oil has now not been above $50 since mid-October and not consistently above that mark since the end of July. “After a summer of lower forecourt prices, motorists are now looking forward to the prospect of yet lower petrol and diesel in the run-up to the expensive festive period. While we are a way off average petrol prices reaching £1 a litre, there is a good chance the most price-competitive fuel retailers will take the plunge.” The price of a barrel of oil began to tumble a year ago having been as high as $115 in mid-2014 and fell to $45 in mid-January which led to the average petrol price reaching a six-year low of 106.09p in early February. While the barrel price rebounded to the $60 level in late February/early March and in late June/early July, it dropped again and has subsequently stayed low. And, even after hitting $40.40 on Monday (16 November), it only went back up slightly on Tuesday, finishing at $41.56. Simon Williams added: “Low oil and fuel prices appear to be here to stay as cutting supply to shore up prices is not an option for OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – as it is dead set on not letting its competitors take any of its share, something which would almost certainly happen with a higher barrel price. With yet more oil due to hit the market as Iran begins to produce again following its nuclear deal with the West, the long-term outlook has to be low oil prices for a further 12 months. “Let’s just hope the Chancellor doesn’t spoil the party by using lower prices as an excuse to raise fuel duty in his Autumn Statement next week. The Treasury’s own research shows that lower fuel prices can boost economic GDP and at a time where some think tanks are predicting the economy will slow, surely the best way to keep the country moving and keep the economy going is to freeze fuel duty.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: www.rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Unleaded finished the month at 107.82p, down from 109.45p at the start, saving another 90p from the cost of filling up an average 55-litre family car. This means since the start of July it costs £5.08 less to fill up with unleaded and £5.87 less for diesel.  Diesel, however, only reduced fractionally in October from 110.26p to 109.95p but is still not far off the lowest price since December 2009 which was recorded in the first week of September at 109.76p. The continued run of lower fuel prices is being driven by the oil price which remains below $50 a barrel despite a 2% increase throughout the month. The RAC Fuel Watch report for October showed a barrel of crude maintained an average price of $48 a barrel, although there was greater fluctuation in October than in previous months with a five-day spell early on where a barrel went over $50 and a dramatic dip towards the end of the month when a barrel hit $45.95 (27 October) – this was almost as low as mid-January ($45.26) when petrol was the lowest it had been for six years (106.09p).  The pound made 2% gain on the dollar ($1.51 to $1.54) helping to keep the wholesale price of petrol and diesel lower as both fuels are traded in dollars. The RAC is currently expecting little change in pump prices over the next fortnight. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “We are currently enjoying a sustained period of lower fuel prices as a result of the long-term deflated oil price which has been brought about by OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – looking to stop competitors taking its share of the market by overproducing and keeping the barrel price low. “A year ago motorists had probably become accustomed to only ever seeing prices go up so having four consecutive months of the petrol price coming down is a pleasant surprise. Fuel is without doubt the biggest cost of motoring and the forecourt price is a constant cause of concern for drivers which makes this relief at the pumps all the more welcome.  “The question is how low will prices go, albeit with the caveat that two-thirds of every till receipt is made up of tax through fuel duty at 57.95p a litre and VAT on top. And, as prices head towards the £1 mark, the tax take rises to 75%.” HMRC oil duty statistics for September show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 3.5% down on August at 3.834bn litres but 1.9% up compared to August 2014. Petrol sales (1.460bn) were 1.1% down on August and diesel (2.374bn) was 5% down on the month before but 2.95% up on the previous August.

Diesel stayed almost the same around the 110p-a-litre mark (109.86p on 1 September to 110.36p on 30 September), but the petrol/diesel price flip was finally reversed after nearly two months of diesel being cheaper than unleaded. \r\n\tThe RAC Fuel Watch report for September reveals that the average price of diesel returned to being more expensive than unleaded on Friday 25 September (petrol 110.01p v diesel 110.27p), having fallen below petrol on Wednesday 29 July\xa0for the first time since summer 2001. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Petrol has now returned to its traditional position of being cheaper than diesel. This is primarily due to lower demand for unleaded as a result of the US summer holiday driving season finishing at the end of August. A secondary factor is that the diesel wholesale price has stayed stronger than petrol because, in the run-up to winter, there is now less diesel in the marketplace – more oil from that ‘part of the barrel’ is being used to produce more profitable domestic heating oil. \r\n\t“The cost of wholesale unleaded fell 2% in September, hopefully paving the way for further reductions at the pump – we predict at least another 2p-a-litre saving to be passed on by retailers within the next fortnight. \r\n\t“The continued lower prices of both petrol and diesel are a result of ongoing low oil prices. The cost of a barrel of crude has now been below $50 since 31 August and is 3% cheaper than it was at the start of September, having come down from $48.98 a barrel to $47.31. The effect of this on pump prices would have been greater had the pound not lost a little ground on the dollar in September.” \r\n\tSince the start of July, the average forecourt price of unleaded has dropped 7p a litre from 117p to the current 109.63p, making a tank £4 cheaper. Diesel, however, has plummeted 10p a litre from 120.63p to 110.36p, giving drivers a saving of £5.65 every time they fill up from empty. \nHMRC oil duty statistics for August show combined sales of petrol and diesel were 1.8% up on July at 3.975bn litres. Petrol sales (1.476bn) were the same as July but down 5.6% on July 2014, whereas diesel (2.499bn) was up 2.7% on the month before and 2.8% ahead of the previous July, making for the second highest number of litres ever sold, only behind November 2014 when 2,501bn litres were sold. \nThe following table shows 3 month, 6 month and 12 month price and percentage change, compared to\xa030/9/2015: \n\n Notes to Editors For all media\xa0enquiries,\xa0please contact the RAC\xa0press office team on +44 (0)1454 664 123.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Fuel falls more than 4p a litre in August as oil price plummets to six-year low&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Sep 03, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;A new 12-month oil low of $41.87 in the last week of August helped to bring the average price of petrol down by 4p a litre for the month to 112.42p, according to the latest RAC Fuel Watch data. Diesel also continued to drop throughout August with a further 5p being shaved off a litre taking the average cost down to 110.40p, still keeping it below petrol. This means motorists are now paying £2 less to fill up an average family-sized petrol car than they were at the start of the month and £2.60 less for a diesel car. The fall in pump prices has been driven by a dramatic reduction in the price of oil. In the run-up to August, oil was at a consistent $60 a barrel, but dipped below $50 a barrel at the start of the month and stayed below $50 for the whole month, reaching a low point of $41.87 on 24 August. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “We thought July had been a good month for motorists but August proved to be better still due to world oil prices reaching their lowest since February 2009. In January we saw oil go down to $45 but then recover to around the $60-a-barrel mark where it stayed for several months until this new level of over-production in August led to a dramatic reduction. “Diesel drivers have benefitted the most this summer due to a new supply of diesel from Saudi Arabia bringing the wholesale price down. They are now paying £5.60 less to fill up than they were at the beginning of July whereas the savings for petrol motorists have only just kicked in with the drop in the price of oil feeding through into lower wholesale and retail prices. “The good times at the pump may, however, be coming to an end as OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which produces 40% of the world’s oil – has said it is willing to meet with other oil producers to discuss a ‘fair’ price for oil. The barrel price has already rebounded and is continuing to trade up around $48 so we may not see a low of $41 a barrel again.  “Due to the global oil over-supply situation we are in, pump prices look unlikely to return to the all-time high levels of 142p for petrol and 147p for diesel experienced in April 2012 so the cost of driving should continue to be cheaper for some time to come.” HMRC oil duty statistics for July* show fuel sales were 1.6% down on June with a 2.4% drop in the number of litres of diesel sold from 2.494bn to 2.433bn. Petrol sales were static at 1.472bn litres, however, compared to July 2014 combined fuel sales were 3.5% up – 2.3% for petrol and 4.3% for diesel.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Diesel falls 5p a litre in July as retailers pass on wholesale price savings&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Aug 04, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Average diesel car fill-up costs £3 less than a month ago Drivers benefit as supermarkets engage in ‘diesel price war’ RAC Fuel Watch data for July shows the average price of diesel at the pumps fell 5p a litre as retailers finally began passing on the savings in the cost of wholesale diesel, which has been below that of petrol since the end of May. At the start of the month diesel was 120.63p, but by the end it had dropped almost 5p to 115.74p. And, on Wednesday 29 Julythe country saw the first forecourt price flip between diesel and petrol since summer 2001 with diesel at 116.28p, just below the average petrol price of 116.64p. Half a penny a litre also came off the petrol price in the month, which reduced from 117.05p to 116.51p. Both petrol and diesel wholesale prices remain low as a result of the price of oil falling below the $60 a barrel mark on 3 July and remaining there ever since. In the course of the month the oil price fell 9% from $61 to $52 a barrel. This combined with the pound staying strong against the dollar at $1.56 is keeping petrol and diesel cheaper.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “July was a month of good news for motorists with diesel vehicles. The 5p a litre diesel saving recorded in July means the cost of filling up an average 55-litre diesel family car, such as a Ford Focus, has dropped by £3 in a month. This is particularly welcome for motorists setting out on their annual holidays who are driving long distances to destinations in the UK.  “And, if the supermarkets continue to battle over prices as they pass on further wholesale cost savings, pump prices should reduce to around an average of 111p a litre – a price last seen in January 2010. This would shave another £2 off a tank of diesel. To put this in perspective, this is even lower than the 113p average price reached in January after oil hit a near six-year low of $45 a barrel. “The cheaper wholesale price of diesel – now almost 6p a litre cheaper than petrol – has been brought about by the fact two new refineries in Saudi Arabia are now producing diesel to meet the large European demand. We expect this to be good long-term news for the nation’s 10.7m diesel car drivers as well as for businesses operating commercial vehicles. Everyone should benefit from a better, fairer deal at the pumps going forwards.” HMRC fuel usage statistics for June show 2.5bn litres of diesel were sold – a 4% increase on May. Petrol sales remained static at 1.5bn litres. Compared to June 2014; however, petrol was down 4% and diesel was up 5%. Combined fuel sales generated £2.3bn revenue for the Government in fuel duty. This was 2.5% up on May and 1.4% up on June 2014. Notes to Editors Media release issued by the RAC. For all media\xa0enquiries, please contact the press team on +44 (0)1454 664 123.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Diesel wholesale cheaper than petrol throughout June, yet pump price gap still remains&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jul 03, 2015&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;Despite the wholesale price of diesel being cheaper than petrol for all of June motorists are still paying 3p a litre more at the pumps. The RAC’s Fuel Watch report for June shows the price of diesel has become the ‘elephant in the room’ with wholesale prices 1p to 3p a litre lower than petrol yet the average price of a litre of diesel is 120p, compared to 117p for petrol. While some retailers have closed the gap between petrol and diesel on the forecourt, more closely reflecting wholesale prices, very few – if any – have moved their diesel price below petrol. In fact, the vast majority of retailers continue to keep a significant gap between the two fuels with diesel often 5p a litre more expensive. The latter group may be operating on wafer thin margins on petrol in order to remain competitive and trading this off against bigger margins on diesel in order to balance the books. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The retail price of diesel has almost become a taboo subject despite 2.4bn litres being sold in May, compared to just 1.5bn litres of petrol. While there are twice as many petrol cars on the road, the increase in diesel usage shown in government statistics and the new car sales figures which show more than 50% of cars and light commercial vehicles leaving the showroom are powered by diesel, confirm that we are increasingly relying on diesel for both business and private use. “Not only are diesel drivers now being demonised due to the increasing concerns over harmful nitrogen dioxide and particulate emissions, they are consistently having to pay a premium for their fuel. And, all this comes after years in which the taxation system has encouraged motorists to buy low carbon dioxide emitting vehicles. This has led to a big take-up of small fuel efficient diesel vehicles by motorists believing their choice of vehicle was good for the environment as well as their pocket. “While retailers are obviously free to choose how much they charge for petrol and diesel, we believe that motorists deserve to be treated fairly and that means forecourt prices that reflect the wholesale market.”  The RAC’s Fuel Watch report shows that the price of diesel should drop by around 5p a litre in the next two weeks based on lower wholesale prices, although the motoring organisation has seen this throughout June with little to no forecourt price change so therefore has little hope of this saving being passed on. Simon Williams added: “Essentially, what is required is a fundamental re-balance of pricing in the retail fuel market. We need greater transparency and a fairer pricing model for both petrol and diesel. We realise that with more and more forecourts shutting up shop every month that fuel retailing may not be as profitable as it once was, but there seems to be a clear intention to make more money from a higher diesel price while at the same time being seen to maintain a lower petrol price.  “We as a nation of motorists are far more focused on petrol prices and therefore there is a perceived benefit from a retailer’s point of view in keeping petrol prices lower for the country’s 20m petrol car owners than it is for the 10m-plus diesel car drivers.” June saw fuel prices maintain an even keel for motorists as a result of oil prices staying flat and the pound remaining stable too. The average price of a litre of petrol was 117p – 14p cheaper than 12 months ago, and diesel was 120.75p – 15p cheaper. Both have gone up since the early February average price lows of 106p for unleaded and 113p for diesel. HMRC fuel usage statistics for May* show the Government brought in £2.2bn in fuel duty revenue – a similar figure to April. This represented a 2.8% year-on-year growth in revenue – £2.182bn in May 2014 compared to £2.243bn in May 2015. May saw 1.478bn litres of petrol and 2.393bn diesel sold, making for a total of 3.871bn litres. Petrol sales experienced a 1.5% month-on-month growth and diesel a 1% drop on April, but year-on-year petrol declined by 1.6% compared to May 2014 and diesel usage grew by 5.7%. \r\n\tIssued by the RAC.

Data from RAC Fuel Watch* reveals petrol went up by another 2.34p to 130.57p in May while diesel increased by 1.74p to 135.54p. This is in stark contrast to 3 February when a litre of unleaded cost an average of 119.54p and diesel was 128.64p.  As a result of the rises petrol is only a penny away from its five-year high of 131.58p which was recorded on 15 October 2018 – the last time unleaded was more expensive than this was 15 July 2014 (131.61p). Diesel hit 136.94p a litre on 30 October – prior to that it was last this high on 10 March 2014 (137.17p). The May pump price increases mean a tank of petrol for a 55-litre family car now costs an average of £71.81 – an increase of £1.29 in May and £6 more than at the start of February. The cost of filling a diesel car also went up by £1 (96p) to £74.55 – £3.80 more than four months ago. The diesel rise is particularly frustrating for the UK’s 13m diesel cars** as the wholesale price has merited substantial forecourt cuts for some weeks. The rise in forecourt prices has been caused by a continued increase in wholesale prices. May unfortunately saw the bad combination of a slightly higher oil price and a weakening pound. The price of crude oil traded well above $70 a barrel for most of the month and the pound lost ground on the dollar, falling from $1.30 to $1.26 – a 4% drop. However, by the end of the month oil had fallen to $65 (-9%) – a price not seen since mid-March, perhaps signalling some much-needed price easing at the pumps.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “May was another miserable month for drivers with the fourth straight average price rise of both petrol and diesel taking us near to a five-year high. Luckily though, oil closed out the month 9% lower at $65 which should soon translate to lower prices at the pumps. “After suffering a steady flow of daily fuel price increases because of rising wholesale costs we urge retailers to reflect this sudden drop in the price of oil by cutting their prices as soon as possible. The supermarkets who buy fuel more often than smaller retailers due to the large volumes they sell should be able to do this straightaway to bring some welcome relief to drivers who have had to endure seemingly ever-increasing prices. “Despite this, the price of diesel has been over-inflated for more than a month. In fact, the wholesale price of diesel has now been lower than petrol since 17 May, yet there is currently an average difference of 5p between the two on our forecourts. Consequently, there is scope to cut the price of diesel by at least 6p a litre. In reality, however, the majority of retailers will no doubt refuse to do this and instead continue to use the saving from the lower diesel wholesale price to subsidise the ‘headline’ petrol price with a view to attracting more customers to their forecourts and stores. “Looking at the bigger picture, until late in May the outlook for fuel prices appeared bleak, but for once the notorious volatility of the oil price might just work in favour of drivers as there are fears supply may start to outstrip demand. This is due to a possible global economic slowdown being sparked by the US’s trade wars with China and Mexico as well as it producing record levels of crude oil. “OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its partners could still put a fly in the ointment as a meeting is scheduled in Vienna for the end of June to discuss production levels. The alliance has been working together on limiting oil production since early 2017 but increased its curbs at the beginning of this year. If they were to decide to go still further this would serve to prop up the barrel price, which inevitably won’t be good news for motorists.”   Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices The North East saw the largest monthly price increase in the UK with 2.71p, taking a litre to 130.25p. London started May with the most expensive unleaded at 129.29p but the South East had the dearest petrol by the end of the month at 131.41p. Northern Ireland was the cheapest throughout May, finishing the month with an average price of 128.99p. Regional average diesel pump prices The East Midlands endured the biggest increase in the cost of diesel with a litre going up to 135.81p on the back of a 1.95p rise. The South East had the most expensive diesel at 136.46p and Northern Ireland the cheapest at 132.56p. Northern Ireland also had the smallest monthly increase at 1.31p a litre.

Data from RAC Fuel Watch* shows a litre of unleaded shot up from 122.62p to 128.06p as retailers passed on wholesale price increases driven by a 5% jump in the cost of a barrel of oil which went up more than $3 to $72.50, having hit a high of $74.38 earlier in the month. It means April 2019 was officially one of the bleakest months for petrol prices in nearly 20 years. April’s price leap is second only to May 2018 when petrol jumped 6p a litre (5.98p) from 123.43p to 129.41p. It is also the third consecutive month of price rises, meaning unleaded has gone up 8.5p a litre from 119.54p to 128.06p since the beginning of February. Diesel also increased by 3p a litre from 130.70p to 133.70p. While not as great an increase as petrol it was still the 18th biggest monthly rise since 2000 – the largest being 8.43p in May 2008.  RAC Fuel Watch also shows the average difference between petrol and diesel wholesale prices was only a penny throughout April, yet the retail price of diesel was an average of 6p a litre more expensive than petrol throughout the month. In terms of filling an average 55-litre family car, the unleaded price rise means the cost has gone up by £3 to £70.43 and for diesel by £1.65 to £73.54. The country’s four big supermarket fuel retailers – Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury – actually increased their petrol prices above the UK average. Their average for unleaded went up by 5.58p a litre from 118.62p to 124.20p (in contrast to the UK average price which rose by 5.44p), with diesel going up by 4.1p from 127.47p to 131.57p.  Motorway petrol went up 3.6p from an average of 141.93p to 145.53p while diesel increased 2.79p from 151.27p to 154.06p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Despite the good weather April turned out to be one of the bleakest months ever for drivers with the second biggest monthly rise in the price of petrol for nearly 20 years.  “RAC Fuel Watch data shows the price of unleaded rose every single day from the end of March for three and half weeks (until 24 April), which is the longest run of daily price rises since May last year when unleaded increased 6p a litre setting a new monthly price rise record dating back to 2000. “The bad news for drivers is that a tank of petrol now costs £3 more than it did at the start of April. This will have a damaging effect on household budgets across the country and will inevitably mean there will be less money available for non-essential spending. “But diesel drivers have much to be aggrieved about as the fuel not only suffered a 3p a litre hike in price, its pump price was 6p higher than petrol on average in April – despite the fact its wholesale cost was very similar to that of petrol.  “It is very clear from our monitoring of forecourt and wholesale prices that retailers have been using the cheaper wholesale cost of diesel to subsidise petrol pump prices and had they not, a new monthly price rise record would have been set. As a result diesel drivers – and businesses that doesn’t buy fuel in advance – are now all paying far more than they should be. To put this pricing discrepancy in perspective, last year the amount of diesel sold was almost double that of petrol (30.5bn v 15.8bn litres). “The rise in forecourt prices is being driven by the increase in the cost of oil which has been brought about by oil producer group OPEC and non-member Russia working together to restrict oil supply, coupled with lower production from Venezuela and Libya due to troubles and US sanctions on Iran. “OPEC is due to meet at the end of next month in Vienna so we can only hope for a relaxation of production targets.” Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices Drivers in Wales had to endure the biggest increase in the price of unleaded with a litre going up 6.1p in April. The South East had the most expensive petrol at the start of the month, but London took the title by the close, with the average price of a litre in the city reaching 129.02p. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest petrol as well as the smallest monthly price rise at 4.89p a litre.  Regional average diesel pump prices The East of England not only had the largest jump in the price of diesel – 3.34p a litre – it also had the most expensive diesel at the end of the month at 134.67p. Northern Ireland also had the cheapest average pump prices at the beginning and end of April, and the smallest monthly increase at just 2.48p a litre.

This means filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded now costs £67.22. The average price of diesel also increased but only 0.70p to 130.67p taking a fill-up to £71.87. This is the second straight monthly increase for both fuels, making unleaded 2p more expensive than it was at the same time in 2018 and 2017 (120.11p – 2018; 120.15p - 2017).  Diesel, however, is nearly 8p dearer (122.82p – 2018; 122.19p – 2017), or £4.30 a tank. But the current price of petrol is still 8p a litre cheaper than it was in October last year (131p), which was the highest price seen since July 2014, and diesel is also 6p cheaper than it was in October (136p in October). The pump price rises have been fuelled by a 4% jump in the cost of oil from $63.81 to $68.07 and a 2% drop in the value of the pound against the dollar ($1.32 to $1.30) – the worst possible combination for motorists. The increase in the wholesale cost of petrol, which equated to 6.5p in March, started to be passed on by the supermarket fuel retailers immediately. This led to a litre of supermarket petrol going up 1.7p in March to 118.59p and a litre of diesel rising 1.27p to 127.48p. Asda and Sainsbury’s both raised their prices by 2p a litre in the month. Asda, however, began a series of almost daily rises from late February, making for a 3.6p litre hike by the close of March (113.7p – 21 Feb to 117.31p – 31 March).  As a result of Asda’s increases, which weren’t mirrored by the other three major supermarkets, the gap between the country’s cheapest fuel retailer on petrol and the other supermarkets has closed. From the end of October until the end of February the other three supermarkets were charging around 3p more for a litre of petrol than Asda but this has now closed again to the customary 1p to 1.5p.  RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “March has been another rough month for petrol drivers. Unleaded has gone up 2p a litre and diesel by just short of a penny. Diesel drivers are particularly feeling the pinch at the moment, as compared to this time last year and the year before a litre is on average 8p more expensive than petrol. Worse still, diesel is also 8p dearer than it was at this time in both 2018 and 2017. “Throughout March the wholesale price of diesel was on average 6p a litre more than petrol. This gap has now closed which should hopefully bring some relief to drivers of diesel vehicles. If retailers play fair with motorists the price of the fuel should fall by around 3p a litre in the next fortnight whereas petrol looks like it’s set to rise further with at least a penny or two likely to go on in the coming weeks.  “Fortunately, normal competition between supermarket fuel retailers over the price of petrol has resumed after four months of Asda being considerably cheaper than its competitors. Whether this is as a result of keener pricing from the others or from Asda moving its unleaded price closer to its competitors is hard to know.  “Supermarkets play a vital role in UK fuel retailing as despite only having a fifth of forecourt sites they have 45% of the fuel market which means that everyone else selling fuel has little option but to compete with them. And, if there isn’t good competition between them it can mean the UK average price of fuel is adversely affected, to the disadvantage of all drivers.” Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices  Regional average diesel pump prices Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting the RAC Fuel Watch webpage.

Data from\xa0RAC Fuel Watch shows the UK average price of a litre of petrol increased by just under a penny (0.88p) to 120.42p by the end of the month while diesel climbed more than a penny (1.24p) to 129.88p.  Since the beginning of November 11p a litre came off the average price of unleaded, taking it from 130.61p to 119.60p at the end of January. Diesel also reduced, but not by as much, instead falling 8p a litre from 136.93p to 128.74p over the same period. As a result of the February price rise, filling up an average 55-litre family car with petrol now costs £66.23 and with diesel £71.43.  The big four supermarkets only raised their prices slightly to 117p for unleaded (up 0.30p) and to 126.10p for diesel (up 0.48p). This was led by Asda, which after more than six weeks of keeping its prices the same, took the decision to pass on slight increases in wholesale prices to its customers.  The price rises were driven by a 5% jump in the price of oil which added $3 across the month taking the barrel price up to $65.13 by the close of February, although at one point it topped $67 – a price not seen since mid-November last year. The increase in the price of crude has been driven by production cuts made by OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) in partnership with Russia.  From a driver’s point of view, the oil price increase was softened a little by a 2% strengthening of the pound against the dollar, which is important as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars. The pound started the month at $1.30 and closed at $1.33. The combination of the oil price rise and the slight strengthening of the pound led to the wholesale price of unleaded rising by under a penny (0.82p) a litre and diesel by 1.82p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Drivers will be disappointed to see prices at the pumps going up again after enjoying three months of reductions.  “What they probably aren’t aware of is that retailers, who held off cuts for weeks when they were warranted, instantly raised their prices when they saw the wholesale price go up very slightly. This is unfortunately clear proof of the infamous ‘rocket and feather’ pricing strategy where prices go up like a rocket and fall like a feather. “Even the cheapest supermarket fuel retailer Asda which held its average petrol price at 113.7p since mid-January flinched, adding more than 1.5p a litre in four days. It will be interesting to see if this comes off again as the wholesale price eased almost straightaway.  “Currently, retailers should actually be reducing their unleaded prices a little, but it remains to be seen whether they will pass on the savings to drivers on the forecourt. Based on their current track record you would have to say this seems unlikely.” Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices London and the North East suffered the biggest rises in the price of unleaded, with 1.18p added on their forecourts. The South East had the dearest petrol at both the start and end of the month but only saw 0.71p go on to its average price. Wales saw the smallest increase and also had the cheapest petrol by the close of February.  London also endured the greatest increase in the price of diesel and had the most expensive price by the end of the month with a litre going up by 1.53p to 130.67p. At 1.28.18p Northern Ireland had the lowest price diesel in the UK.

Data from RAC Fuel Watch* shows the UK average price of unleaded came down by 1.32p to 120.92p while diesel dropped 1.27p to 130.01p. This means it now costs an average of £65.78 to fill up a 55-litre family car with petrol – £6 less than it did at the end of October. A tank of diesel, however, has only come down £3.78 to £71.50 over the same period.  Prices at the country’s four biggest supermarkets are an average of 3p a litre lower at 116.66p for petrol and 125.43p for diesel. At motorway service areas, however, a litre of unleaded sets drivers back 138.87p and diesel 147.55p. RAC Fuel Watch figures show the wholesale price of petrol stayed flat in January while diesel increased by 2p a litre, but when compared to retail prices they were low still low enough to demand pump price reductions during the month. Sadly for drivers though, retailers decided not to pass these on.  The RAC says this explains why the UK average price of fuel has fallen despite the wholesale market being static for unleaded and rising for diesel. If retailers were to pass on existing savings in their wholesale costs the price of petrol ought to reduce by 3p a litre in the next two weeks, and diesel by 2p a litre. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “While it’s obviously good news the price of fuel has fallen for three months in a row, the story behind the simple forecourt average figures is quite disturbing. Looking at the wholesale data over the last two months reveals that we should have been paying far less for our petrol and diesel than we have been.  “Unfortunately, three of supermarket fuel retailers appear to have changed their pricing policies for the long term by increasing the margin they take on a litre of petrol to about 2p. This has meant the average price of unleaded has not reduced by as much as it should have because smaller retailers nearby haven’t had to lower their prices as much in order to compete. “The wholesale fuel market operates very transparently, but the same can’t be said of the retail market. We understand retailers are free to charge what they like for their fuel and that it’s then up to consumers whether they’re prepared to pay their prices or not. Unfortunately, consumers don’t have an easy way of knowing whether they are being charged a fair price so they have to trust they aren’t being ripped off. That’s why we always encourage drivers to check the current average price of petrol and diesel, and see if they can beat that price when paying for fuel locally. “Combine this with the fact some bigger retailers vary their prices from location to location, fuel is an essential purchase for most people and that shopping around is not that easy, and you have the perfect recipe for drivers being charged over the odds for what is essentially a commodity.” Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices The North West saw the greatest reduction in the price of unleaded in the UK with 1.36p coming off a litre taking it to 118.95p. The North East, however, had the cheapest petrol at the start and close of January (118.98p and 117.95p). The South East was once again the most expensive.\xa0 Regional average diesel pump prices The East of England enjoyed a 1.59p drop in the price of diesel, surpassing the UK average fall of 1.27p.

The average price of unleaded went down 2.75p from 123.67p to 120.92p and diesel reduced by 3.08p from 133.09p to 130.01p. Oil, however, crashed 14.5% from $60.31 at the start of the month to $51.52 on 27 December which should have meant prices at the pump were considerably lower.  RAC Fuel Watch data shows the price of unleaded should come down in the next fortnight by more than 8p a litre to 113p a litre and diesel by 10p a litre to 120p if retailers passed on savings in the lower wholesale price. This would see the supermarkets charging around 110p a litre for petrol and 117p for diesel. At the end of December it cost on average £66.51 to fill up a 55-litre family car with unleaded – £1.51 less than November – and £71.51 for the equivalent diesel vehicle, and a saving of £1.69 on the previous month.  A litre of unleaded cost an average of 117.23p at the four biggest supermarkets, and diesel 126.76p. The average price at an Asda forecourt, however, was 114.7p a litre for petrol and 125.53p for diesel. At motorway service areas petrol was sold for an average of 138.48p and diesel for 148.14p. But despite the overall picture showing a reduction in the cost of fuel in December, the RAC fears fuel retailing among the big four supermarkets may have changed forever – to the detriment of every driver – as only Asda is close to reflecting the lower wholesale prices at the pumps.  Since mid-October the other supermarket fuel retailers have chosen not to compete as closely on the price of unleaded as they usually do – they are currently charging up to 4p a litre more for unleaded than Asda. As a result drivers across the UK have lost out as the average price of petrol should have dropped by that amount through the ripple effect caused by independents trying to match their closest supermarket rivals’ prices.  RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “While it’s good news fuel prices have fallen for the second month in a row, drivers should feel cheated they have not come down further. The problem is twofold: firstly, there should be a cut in the price of petrol to properly reflect lower wholesale prices and secondly, three of our biggest supermarkets appear no longer to be competing on the price of unleaded, in particular, as closely with the lowest price supermarket retailer, Asda. “Normally, the other three supermarkets are 1p to 1.5p more expensive on unleaded, but our data shows that since October they have abandoned this strategy in favour of pricing 2.5p to 4p higher for a litre of petrol. The decision by all supermarkets to take more profit on a litre has led to every driver having to pay more to fill up than they should have to. This is because the UK average is negatively affected as other retailers are not being forced through competition to lower their prices.  “This is a highly unusual situation, the likes of which we haven’t seen before. If this new pricing behaviour continues into 2019 this could spell a bleaker year for drivers at the pumps no matter what happens to the price of wholesale fuel. Drivers could be paying around 3p a litre more for their fuel simply because of a retail pricing decision at three supermarkets which together sell a high volume of fuel. This is important as supermarkets only operate 18% of the UK’s 8,422 forecourts but sell around 45% of all the fuel. “Of course, it should also be the case that smaller retailers ought to be moving their prices down on their own without having to be forced to do so by nearby supermarkets. We commend those smaller retailers that proactively do this. “Unfortunately, unless you live near the cheapest supermarket fuel retailer or an independent retailer that is very price-competitive, the amount you pay for your petrol and diesel is likely to be far higher than it should be. “It is important to point out that every fuel retailer is at liberty to charge what they want for their petrol or diesel so aside from the Government taking the unlikely step of capping retailer margins there is little that can be done to change this. Sadly, it means motorists are completely at the mercy of retailers because just one major supermarket passing on savings in the wholesale price isn’t enough to change prices across the majority of UK forecourts.  “Fortunately, despite the weakness of the pound against the dollar drivers are enjoying a cheaper time at the pumps than they were in the middle of 2018. This is due to the price of oil falling substantially due a glut in supply caused by a global economic slow-down. Even though oil producers group OPEC has agreed to limit supply there is still too much oil in circulation which has led to the price of barrel coming down.”  Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices Northern Ireland saw the biggest drop in the price of unleaded with a 3.91p reduction in a litre from 123.81p to 119.90p. The North East, however, while only seeing a 3p decrease had the cheapest petrol in the UK, finishing December at 119.20p. The East was charging the most for a litre of unleaded at the beginning of the month, but by the close the South East had regained its customary title, with an average price of 121.87p.   Regional average diesel pump prices Scotland enjoyed the biggest UK average reduction in the price of diesel, with 3.15p coming off a litre to a price of 130.27p. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest diesel at both the start and finish of the month and the South East was the dearest place in the UK to buy diesel with a litre costing 131.22p at the end of December.

This means the average cost of filling a 55-litre family car with petrol has stayed at £71.84 when it should have been nearly £2 less (£1.92) had retailers done the right thing and reflected the lower wholesale price on the forecourt. Even though conditions were ripe for a petrol price cut from the middle of the month the big four supermarket fuel retailers – which play a vital role in setting the market for fuel prices across the UK – refused to lower the price for drivers. It was not until the end of the month that Asda finally reduced unleaded by an average of 2.4p across all its forecourts.  But this has sadly not led to other retailers following suit by lowering their prices and has therefore had little effect either on the average price of unleaded at the supermarkets, or on the UK average. The average price of petrol at Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons actually increased by 0.6p a litre in October (126.88p to 127.48p) despite the drop in the wholesale cost. Diesel, however, suffered its fourth consecutive monthly price increase, rising by 2.38p from 134.50p to 136.88p, making the cost of a 55-litre tank £75.28. Buying it at a supermarket saves 3p a litre with the average price standing at 133.67p a litre at the end of October, having risen 2.35p from 131.32p. Refilling with petrol at a motorway service area, however, now costs an average of 149.32p – a slight reduction of 0.3p a litre on the start of the month when it was 149.62p. Frighteningly, a litre of diesel at a motorway forecourt is an average of 155.22p – an increase of 2.7p in October. A tank of petrol is therefore £82.29 while diesel is an eye-watering £85.37. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “Every motorist driving a petrol car should feel aggrieved that the price of a litre stayed the same in October when it should have fallen by more than 3p. The biggest retailers who are responsible for selling the most fuel have taken drivers for a ride.  “In doing so they have inadvertently but categorically proved that ‘rocket and feather’ pricing does exist. Had wholesale costs increased at the same rate the supermarkets would have passed these on at the pump straightaway just as they did in April and May this year.  “Unfortunately, other retailers that don’t buy wholesale fuel as frequently are just as guilty as they have now had plenty of time to cut their prices. They were, more than likely, waiting for the supermarkets to lead the way, but this surely isn’t a valid excuse. “So while there are times when fuel pricing in relation to wholesale prices does operate transparently, sadly October just wasn’t one of those months. “We strongly urge all retailers to lower their petrol prices in line with the reduced wholesale cost of unleaded. And, with the pound gaining strength against the dollar on 1 November, there will be even greater scope for a cut.” The lower wholesale price of petrol has been brought about by an 11% fall in the price of oil which has gone from $84.73 at the start of October to $75.55 at the close. Sterling – the other important factor in determining wholesale costs – lost 2% on the dollar, dropping from $1.30 to $1.27 in the month. Regional fuel price variation The North East had the cheapest petrol in the UK at the end of October at 129.25p a litre. The South East had the most expensive at 131.45p. It also had the dearest diesel at 137.72p. Northern Ireland had the lowest priced diesel at 135.55p. The North East, however, made up for having the lowest price petrol as it suffered the biggest diesel price increase at 2.71p taking a litre to 136.55p.

The wholesale price of unleaded has in the last few days dropped below £1 a litre which means the pump price of petrol at supermarket forecourts should really be around 125p a litre accounting for delivery, retailer margin and VAT.\r\n \r\n\tOil has fallen from a four-year high of $86.23 on 4 October to $81.20 on 11 October. Meanwhile the pound has improved against the dollar from $1.29 on 2 October to $1.32 on 11 October.\r\n \r\n\tThe price of diesel, however, is not due to come down, although the rises seen in recent weeks may have come to an end for the time being. The average price of diesel across the UK is now 136.44p while at the major supermarkets it is more than 3.5p cheaper at 132.63p. Diesel has risen by nearly 13p a litre this year while petrol has increased by 10p.\r\n \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “Major fuel retailers should be reacting to the sharp drop in the wholesale price of petrol by knocking at least 3p a litre off at the pumps. Motorists have suffered with rising petrol prices for most of this year with 10p a litre being added since the start of January.\r\n \r\n\t“We are sure retailers will do the right thing and pass the savings on to drivers, but the question is how long will it take for them to do this. As this has come about as a result of a sudden drop in the wholesale price they can’t yet be accused of holding off on cutting, but if prices don’t fall soon then we fear this will be further evidence of the so-called ‘rocket and feather’ effect where prices go up far more quickly than they fall.\r\n \r\n\t“The speed with which we have gone from seemingly endless pump price rises to a sudden moment when they should really be coming down very clearly demonstrates the volatility of wholesale fuel and how UK motorists are at the mercy of the international markets.\r\n \r\n\t“The oil and currency changes have also improved the diesel price situation, with the constant rises coming to a halt for the time being.”\r\n Notes to Editors For all media\xa0enquiries,\xa0please contact the RAC\xa0press team on +44 (0)1454 664 123.

Pump prices continue to creep ever upward with unleaded increasing by 1.65p to 130.59p and diesel by 1.32p to 132.19p in the month. A year ago, however, petrol was 117.51p and diesel was 118.37p. Sadly, the combination of a weaker pound and an oil price of over $70 a barrel has sent prices shooting up. In the past year only the months of June, February and October have given drivers a little respite at the petrol pumps. And it was worse for diesel drivers with nine months of increases.   The average price of petrol in the UK is now at its highest since the end of July 2014 just before the price of a barrel of oil began to freefall and diesel is at its most expensive since the beginning of October the same year. The very important costly difference for every driver, however, is that back then oil was $106 a barrel and the pound was worth $1.70.  Now, in stark contrast, oil finished August at $77.54 while sterling was only worth $1.29 which means both petrol and diesel are far more expensive for retailers to buy on the wholesale market. So despite the lower oil price, the substantially weakened pound has caused fuel prices to reach their highest levels for the last four years.  There have been no significant reductions in the average cost of supermarket fuel since 24 June, meaning by the end of August prices had crept up by 3.38p for petrol (123.77p to 127.15p) and by 3.12p for diesel (127.23p to 130.35p). The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with unleaded is £71.82 – an increase of 91p on July and £7.32 dearer than a year ago. For diesel, the equivalent cost is £73.29 for a tank today – 73p more than last month and £8.19 more expensive than at the end of August 2017. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “August was another bad month for motorists and it’s rapidly becoming a horrible year on the UK’s forecourts and it looks like further increases are inevitable. Having benefitted from some very low prices two and a half years ago drivers get a nasty shock every time they go to fill up their cars, having to fork out more and more. “While it’s clearly a tough time for regular motorists unfortunately there is currently no end in sight to the rising cost of fuel. With the pound at such a low against the dollar, and fuel being traded in the US currency, it will only take a moderate rise in the price of oil for some eye-wateringly high prices to be seen at the pumps.  “With many factors at play on the global oil market the price of a barrel could easily break through the $80 mark and stay there. If this were to happen it would be dire news for drivers and we could even see pump prices heading towards the record highs of April 2012 when petrol hit an average of 142p a litre and diesel 148p.” Pricing – what has happened to UK pump prices since September 2017  Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices The North East and Scotland suffered the largest rise in the price of unleaded in August at 1.81p a litre. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest petrol at the start and end of the month, closing August at 129.38p but the East Midlands had the smallest a 1.45p a litre. In the South East unleaded was the most expensive across the UK at 131.46p.  Regional average diesel pump prices** Diesel went up the most in the North West and North East, increasing by around 1.48p a litre. Northern Ireland experienced the lowest increase at 99p as well having the cheapest diesel at 131.77p a litre. Unsurprisingly, the South East also had the dearest diesel in the land at 134.03p.\xa0  Notes to Editors * UK average fuel prices quoted in theRAC Fuel Watch August 2018 report are based on Experian Catalist data from 1 to 30 August 2018 (pump prices).

Last month saw the continuation of recent ‘see-saw’ pump price changes – while drivers were stung with\xa0one of the worst petrol price rises through May 2018, the following month saw\xa0average prices fall by around 2p a litre. This began to be reversed in July meanwhile, with a litre of unleaded up by 1.08p (127.72p to 128.8p) in the month and diesel up by 1.03p (130.82p to 131.85p) Data shows that it was supermarkets that increased their prices the most in July, largely cancelling out the price cuts that they introduced just a few weeks earlier in June. The price of an average litre of supermarket unleaded was up 1.64p to 125.34p, while diesel was up 1.62p to 128.88p. Motorway service areas, which tend to charge to the most for fuel, increased the price of a litre of petrol by 1.19p to 146.09p, but left diesel almost unchanged at 148.14p. Across the UK, it now costs drivers on average £70.84 to fill up a 55-litre family-sized petrol car (up 59p on June), and £72.52 for a similar diesel model (up 57p on June). There is a high degree of volatility in wholesale fuel prices at the moment, as a result of the sharply fluctuating oil price which, after starting the month at just under $77 a barrel, fell to $70 on 17 July before recovering again to $74 by the end. A number of factors have contributed to the price changes – while\xa0OPEC’s announcement that its member countries will begin pumping more oil had the effect of pushing prices down, these are now being offset by both the ongoing tensions between the US and Iran over its nuclear deal, and with China over trade and the threat of tariffs which can force prices up. RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis said: “July saw a return to rising prices at the UK’s forecourts, following some price cuts in the previous month – the rollercoaster effect of rising and falling prices that drivers will have witnessed in recent months is certainly in full swing. “The volatility of the price of a barrel of oil, and in turn wholesale fuel prices, makes it difficult to determine where prices might go next. The announcement in June by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that its member countries would be increasing oil production could have been a trigger for further price falls, but the complicated disagreements between the United States – another big oil producer – and Iran and China are making prices go the other way. The result is a great deal of uncertainty on what might happen with UK fuel prices in the coming weeks. “Fortunately for UK drivers, the pound remained stable against the US dollar – which is important as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars. A weakening pound means it costs more for retailers to buy fuel in, which in turn tends to mean higher prices at the pumps. “What is certain however is how much more expensive it is to fill up a car this summer compared to last year. At the end of July 2018 it cost £7.50 (12%) more to fill a 55-litre unleaded fuel tank compared to the same point in 2017, and £8.77 (14%) more to fill an equivalent diesel.” ‘See-saw’ pricing – what has happened to UK pump prices since the start of the year  Regional fuel price variation  Regional average unleaded pump prices** The largest increase in unleaded prices was in Scotland, although it is still on average more expensive to fill up in the South East of England compared to every other part of the UK.

RAC Fuel Watch data shows that petrol fell from 129.37p a litre across the UK to 127.59p after the supermarkets cut their prices in response to lower wholesale costs. Diesel also reduced but only by 1.5p a litre from 132.32p to 130.74p. As a result, it now costs £70.17 to fully top up an average 55-litre family car with petrol (nearly £1 (98p) a tank less than it did a month ago) and £71.91 for a similar car that runs on diesel (86p a tank less than a month ago). The greatest price reductions were seen across UK supermarkets, where an average of 2.4p came off the price of a litre of unleaded, and 2p off a litre of diesel. Drivers filling up at motorway services meanwhile saw no reduction at all in prices during June – with a litre of petrol remaining at 145p and diesel at 148p per litre.  The fall in the price of petrol and diesel occurred early on in June, with some of the largest fuel retailers responding to calls by the RAC to cut their prices in the wake of falling wholesale prices. Unfortunately however, wholesale prices started to creep up again at the very end of the month – snuffing out the possibility of petrol and diesel prices becoming any cheaper through the start of July. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The big fuel retailers finally bowed to pressure in early June by cutting the price of both petrol and diesel at the pumps – offering some respite to drivers who just a month earlier had experienced the largest jump in average forecourt prices since the RAC began tracking prices. “But while the price of oil slid back to around $72 a barrel in the middle of month, since this point it has been rising again – ending June nearer $76 a barrel and with wholesale fuel prices now also starting to rise again.  “So we remain in a period of real volatility when it comes to fuel prices. Late in June the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which represents some of the world’s largest oil producing nations, agreed to increase global oil production. While this would normally signal cheaper oil, and in turn cheaper fuel prices, other factors have been at play – namely an escalating trade dispute between the United States and other major countries and the prospect of renewed sanctions placed on another oil-producing nation, Iran. “At the same time, the pound remains comparatively weak against the US dollar, which reduces the buying power of UK fuel retailers. With fuel costing them more to buy in, this invariably means higher prices are passed on to drivers at the pumps. As a result, motorists sadly shouldn’t hold out much hope for cheaper fuel in time for the start of the school summer holidays.  “It has been reported that the Government is considering ending the fuel duty freeze. Aside from the fact that petrol and diesel in the UK are subject to some of the highest levels of taxation anywhere in Europe, it is also the case that the fuels are at their highest prices for more than three years. With a significantly weaker pound, it would only take a few further oil prices rises this year to see prices start to rocket.”  Regional fuel price variation Regional average unleaded pump prices** While London saw the largest drop in average petrol prices in June, it remains one of the most expensive places to fill up – second only to the South East of England. The North East is the cheapest place to buy the fuel. It is a similar picture when it comes to diesel: London saw the largest fall in average diesel prices but it stills costs more to fill up there than in most other parts of the UK, with Northern Ireland currently the  cheapest.

The May 2018 rise has made the cost of a tank of diesel for a family car £3.37 more expensive at £72.81.\r\n \r\n\tThe RAC Fuel Watch data also shows the average prices of both petrol and diesel have gone up every single day since 22 April, adding 8p a litre in the process – the longest sustained price increase since March 2015.\r\n \r\n\tIn May the big four supermarkets raised petrol by 5.49p a litre and diesel by 5.88p while on the motorway, service stations added 6.37p to unleaded, taking it to 144.75p a litre, and 6.69p to diesel making it an eye-watering 147.80p a litre – 15p a litre above average UK prices for both fuels.\r\n \r\n\tThe forecourt increases have been driven by a jump in the price of oil, coupled with a weakening of the pound against the dollar. Oil broke through the $80 a barrel mark twice in May – something which has not been seen for three and a half years (since 12 November 2014).\r\n \r\n\tOverall, May saw a 3% increase in the price of a barrel of oil (from $74.31 to $76.39) and a 2% drop in the value of the pound against the dollar ($1.35 to $1.33), making the wholesale price for retailers more expensive as fuel, like oil, is traded in dollars.\r\n \n\n \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “May was a hellish month for motorists. Sadly, they have been besieged by pump price rises for three months with nearly 9p a litre being added to petrol since the beginning of March.\r\n \r\n\t“The rising oil price together with a weaker pound is a punitive combination for anyone that drives regularly. For many people there is little alternative to the car for the majority of journeys they have to make so it is therefore very difficult to avoid feeling the pinch of rising pump prices.\r\n \r\n\t“In the last week of May the oil price cooled a little to $76 a barrel which is slightly better news for motorists as the RAC’s two-week forecast is currently showing that average prices may even reduce by a penny or so. While this isn’t much, and could easily change in response to oil trading this week, it is at least a sign that the constant rise in forecourt prices may have stopped for the time being.\r\n \r\n\t“Looking at the bigger picture, there is talk that OPEC – the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – may agree at its meeting on 22 June in Vienna to change its tack of restricting oil supply. The group, together with Russia, have been limiting production with a view to removing the long-term oil glut. This strategy has been successful and, as intended, caused the barrel price to rise. If a decision is taken to increase supply it may provide some much-needed relief for motorists at the pumps in the UK.”\r\n \nRegional fuel price variation\n \r\n\tThe North West experienced the biggest rise in petrol prices with a litre going up 5.98p in May to 128.72p. Northern Ireland saw the smallest increase at 5.07p a litre, although unusually their unleaded was not the cheapest in the UK as that honour went instead to the North East with a litre costing 128.24p at the end of May. The South East once again was the most expensive place to buy petrol with a litre averaging 129.83p.\r\n \r\n\tLooking at diesel, drivers in Wales endured the greatest increase on the forecourt with a litre jumping by 6.07p to 132.03p. The North East and South East had the smallest rise at 5.66p, but a litre of diesel in the South East is the most expensive in the UK at 132.73p.\r\n \n\n \nRegional average unleaded pump prices**\n Notes to Editors * UK average fuel prices quoted in the RAC Fuel Watch May 2018 report are based on Experian Catalist data from 1 to 31 May 2018.

The price hikes have been driven by the rapidly rising cost of oil which yesterday hit $80 a barrel for the first time since mid-November 2014. And even more rises could be on the horizon as one oil chief has speculated that the barrel price could rise to $100 again – a price last seen in August 2014. If this were to happen pump prices could get close to the record levels seen in April 2012 when an average litre of unleaded was 142.48p and diesel was 147.93p. On Thursday (17 May 2018) the petrol price went up 126.62p a litre while diesel was even higher at 129.41p. The RAC’s two-week price prediction, however, has unleaded increasing to 128.5p and diesel to 131.5p. Should oil hit $100 a barrel, with the pound staying at its current low level against dollar of $1.35, we could unfortunately see petrol being sold for an average of 141p a litre and diesel for 144p.  This would make it £8 more expensive to fill up a 55-litre family car with petrol or diesel (petrol – £69.64 to £77.55; diesel – £71.18 to £79.20). This is a shocking £22 a tank more expensive for unleaded than in early 2016 and nearly £24 dearer for diesel. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Fuel prices are now at their highest since mid-October 2014 (16 October 2014) which means we are paying 25p more a litre than we were at the start of 2016 when oil crashed to $26 a barrel and the average price of both fuels was around 101p.  “And, sadly for motorists, and household budgets up and down the UK, the worst may be still yet to come. If the price of oil goes up towards $100 a barrel we will very likely see a return to the dark days of April 2012 when petrol and diesel hit record highs. Even though the oil price was higher then (around $120 a barrel) today’s weaker exchange rate will lead to similar prices at the pumps. “This will inevitably force families to make some tough choices about how they spend their money. We know from experience people cut back on longer social journeys in order to save money. It is also likely to have a negative effect on consumer spending as putting fuel in the car to get to work takes priority over shopping and eating out. “The oil price has increased by $30 a barrel since last July as a result of OPEC (the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and Russia limiting production to reduce an oversupplied market. On top of this we now the United States’ decision to re-impose economic sanctions on Iran which is the third biggest oil producer in OPEC. This will tighten supply even further and cause the barrel price to go up even more. The oil glut that made fuel prices so low two to three years ago is fast becoming a distant memory and the bad times of the high pump prices of 2012 may unfortunately be returning.” Motorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

Diesel rose 2.94p a litre from 123.08p to 126.02p. \r\n\tNot since December 2016 have average fuel prices risen so sharply. The increase then was 3p a litre for both fuels, with petrol rising to 117.23p a litre and diesel to 119.63p. The last time the average price of unleaded was as expensive at it is now was in mid-November 2014. Diesel last exceeded 126p a litre on 1 December 2014. \r\n\tRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “A 12% surge in the price of oil* from $67 a barrel to $75 has cost motorists dear in April. A 3p a litre rise at the pumps is fortunately fairly unusual, but it’s definitely bad news as it means drivers are now paying 8p more a litre than they did last summer. \r\n\t“The cost of filling up an average family-sized 55-litre car with petrol is now nearly £68 (£67.76) which is £4.50 more expensive than it was last July. For diesel car drivers it’s even worse with a tank costing over £69 (£69.31), which is £5.50 more. \r\n\t“The dramatic rise in the oil price and its knock-on effect on the cost of fuel is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the four big supermarkets, which sell the largest volumes and therefore buy fuel in more quickly than other retailers, have raised their prices even more steeply. A litre of supermarket petrol went up 3.2p to 120.17p, and diesel by 3.3p to 123p, signifying they are quickly passing on increased wholesale costs to motorists. \r\n\t“Unfortunately, the price of oil gained $8 in April driven by a combination of international issues, all of which could negatively affect global supply. The biggest of these is the fear that the United States could re-impose crippling economic sanctions on Iran – the third largest oil producer in OPEC – over its controversial nuclear energy programme which it has been limiting as agreed with six world powers, including the US and the UK. \r\n\t“The outlook for fuel prices is not good at the moment as the oil price is well over $70 a barrel, and if the US does try to re-impose sanctions on Iran and supply drops, motorists will end up paying far more at the pumps. Our current two-week prediction is for prices to go up by a penny or so, but this could quickly get worse if oil gets more expensive and the pound weakens any further.” \nRegional fuel price variation \n \r\n\tNorthern Ireland unusually experienced the biggest increase in petrol prices with a 3.47p rise from being the cheapest in the UK at 119.47p a litre to a ‘middle of the road’ 122.94p. The West Midlands saw the smallest increase at 2.38p to 122.68p. The South East is still the most expensive place to buy petrol with a litre costing 124.05p at the end of April. \r\n\tLooking at diesel prices, motorists in Scotland were subject to the biggest uplift – 3.16p – to 126.06p, which was only just worse than Northern Ireland, although drivers there can take some solace from the knowledge that they are buying the cheapest diesel in the UK at 125p a litre. The most expensive diesel can be found in the South East where a litre now costs 126.79p.  \nRegional average unleaded pump prices  \nRegional average diesel pump prices \r\n\tMotorway fuel prices were largely unchanged in April with a litre of petrol costing 138.43p (a rise of just 0.34p) and diesel 141.11p – a slightly larger rise of 1.13p. This means both fuels are more than 15p a litre more expensive than the average UK prices. \r\n\tMotorists can keep abreast of the latest fuel prices by visiting: rac.co.uk/fuelwatch or following #racfuelwatch on Twitter.

The average price of unleaded dropped to 120.14p from 122.34p and diesel to 122.86p from 125.08p following two major cuts from Britain’s ‘big four’ supermarkets made within days of each other. This was in response to calls for cuts from the RAC (8 Feb &amp; 15 Feb) due to the falling price of both fuels on the wholesale market, which was itself triggered by a fall in the oil price. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude ended February 4% lower than at the start at $65.66 having dropped to a near three-month low of $61.46 in the middle of the month (13 February). The fall in the oil price was caused by both an unexpected increase in fuel stocks in the United States and the reopening of the major Forties oil pipeline in the North Sea which had been closed for unplanned maintenance – with it open again, nearly half a billion extra barrels of oil a day are made available to the market. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “After a succession of fuel price rises taking petrol to its highest level in three years in January, motorists finally saw a reversal of fortune in February as a result of a lower oil price which made some significant cuts at the pumps possible. “We commended the supermarkets for responding swiftly to our calls for pump price reductions, not least because we know what impact their pricing can have on other fuel retailers. But we do understand how much harder it can be for smaller retailers who don’t buy as frequently as the supermarkets to cut their prices as a result of sudden or short-term wholesale price changes. However, we are aware of some smaller retailers who pride themselves on having very low prices. “The question for drivers now, of course, is what happens to prices next. While the pound has weakened a little against the dollar – which is important as fuel is traded in dollars – the oil price remains around $65. This has created some downward pressure on wholesale petrol and diesel prices. Whether this means there is scope for another forecourt price cut in the next few weeks remains to be seen and is something we will monitor extremely closely.” It now costs on average £66.08 to fill the tank of a 55-litre family petrol car, or £67.57 if the car runs on diesel. The average price of filling up at a supermarket stands at £64.34 for petrol (116.98p per litre) and £65.75 for diesel (119.54p per litre). Regional fuel price variation While Wales recorded the largest drop in its average unleaded prices in February (down 2.65p through the month), the cheapest petrol was sold in the North East (119.08p per litre). The South East was once again the most expensive place to buy unleaded at 121.19p per litre. Northern Ireland remains the cheapest place to buy diesel at an average of 121.76p per litre, contrasting with the South East that remains the most expensive location to purchase the fuel (123.68p per litre). Scotland recorded the largest fall in diesel prices this month, a drop of 2.55p (122.86p per litre). February also saw a continuation of the phenomenon of supermarket-led ‘hyper local’ fuel price wars, where fuel is being sold at loss in a bid to win customers to their stores. For instance, in Taunton in Somerset three supermarkets have been trying to outdo each other to attract drivers, leading to prices as low as £108.7 for unleaded (Tuesday 6 March).

RAC Fuel Watch is a comprehensive guide to the latest UK unleaded petrol and diesel prices – both at the wholesale level and at the pump. RAC Fuel Watch analyses how prices changed through the previous month and compares the most recent prices with those from three, six and 12 months before. Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;January sees fuel prices rise for third month in row&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jan 31, 2018&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The national average price of petrol and diesel rose in January for the third month in a row, RAC Fuel Watch data reveals. Unleaded increased 1.34p at the pumps to 122.24p a litre while diesel went up 1.56p to 125.04p a litre. This means the price of petrol has increased 4p a litre since October 2017 when it was around 118p. Diesel has gone up 5p a litre, rising from around 120p in October to 125p. Petrol is now at its highest point since late November 2014 and diesel the highest since early December 2014. The average price charged by the big four supermarket fuel retailers suffered a bigger rise at 2p a litre, taking the average price of a litre of supermarket petrol to 119.76p and diesel to 122.45p. The retail fuel price rises have been sparked by a 2% increase in the price of oil, albeit somewhat softened by a more recent 5% boost in the value of the pound to $1.42 on 31 January. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The start of 2018 hasn’t been good for motorists as they’ve had to endure their third consecutive monthly increase at the pumps. Both petrol and diesel are now at their highest points for more than three years which is bound to be making a dent in household budgets.” Filling a 55-litre family car with petrol now costs £67.23 whereas the diesel equivalent is more expensive at £68.77. This is in stark contrast to the cheapest point of 2017 in July when a tank of unleaded was £4.35 cheaper and a diesel fill-up was £5.51 cheaper. Simon Williams added: “There is a glimmer of hope that some of the heat in the forecourt price of fuel could cool in February as our current two-week forecast shows reductions of a penny for petrol and two pence for diesel.  “Whether this will filter through at the pumps is questionable as retailers are generally loath to pass on wholesale savings when they consider them to be marginal.  “While the fuel market is very hard to predict at the best of times there is currently even greater uncertainty as the price of oil went through the $70 a barrel mark in January for the first time in more than three years while sterling has strengthened against the dollar making wholesale fuel cheaper as it’s traded in dollars.  “We urge fuel retailers to be fair to motorists and pass on the current savings in the wholesale price of petrol and diesel at the pump. Reflecting downward movement in wholesale prices on the forecourt, however small, is important for retailers as motorists generally believe there is little transparency in the price of fuel, unless of course costs are on the up when they understand all too well they will quickly be paying more to fill up.” Regional fuel price variation Scotland suffered the largest increase in the price of both unleaded and diesel. Petrol north of the border went up 1.76p a litre in January from 120.12p to 121.88p. The North East, however, had the smallest rise with only a penny being added to the price – 120.40p to 121.49p. By the close of January the West Midlands recorded the lowest average price of petrol at 121.49p, although Northern Ireland’s was almost identical at 121.50p. The South East was customarily the most expensive at 123.15p.  Scotland’s diesel increase was a whopping 2.34p a litre – 123.48p to 125.25p – considerably above the UK average rise of 1.56p. The West Midlands had the smallest hike at just over a penny a litre. The East of England, however, just took the South East’s title as the most expensive place in the UK to buy diesel with a litre averaging 125.73p there. Northern Ireland remains the cheapest for diesel with a litre costing 124.02p at the end of January after a 1.78p rise.

A litre of unleaded went up from 118.43p to 120.78p (2.35p) and diesel from 120.96p to 123.18p (2.22p) as a result of oil spending the whole month above the $60 a barrel mark. The cost of filling a 55-litre family car with petrol is now £66.43 – £3.55 more than in July when unleaded was at its cheapest point of 2017 at 114.33p. A tank of diesel now costs £67.75 – £1.22 more than October and £4.50 more than July when diesel was its 2017 low point of 115.02p. Compared to February 2016, however, when both fuels were an average of 102p a litre a petrol fill-up is £10 more expensive and the diesel equivalent is £11.65 dearer. The RAC Fuel Watch report for November also shows the price of petrol at the big four supermarkets increased by 2.37p a litre from 114.91p to 117.28p, but diesel rose less than it did across all retailers – 1.72p a litre compared to 2.22p – from 117.78p to 119.50p.  Pump prices have risen as a result of higher wholesale costs brought about by the increased price of oil. They have, however, been kept in check to some extent by the strengthening of the pound, which is important as fuel like oil is traded in dollars. The pound rose 2% from $1.32 at the start of November to $1.35 by the close. The end of the month also saw the OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meet in Vienna on 30 November to discuss the level of oil production among its 14 member nations. The organization has been restricting production together with some non-members, most notably Russia, with a view to propping up prices which fell to a low of $26 in January 2016 as part of its over-production strategy. The meeting concluded with the production cut being extended from its scheduled conclusion at the end of March to the close of 2018. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “The market had been expecting OPEC to extend its production cut until the end of next year so after an initial rise in the price of oil during the day of the meeting, things cooled down.  “Even though the oil price is now consistently above $60 a barrel, the increased value of sterling against the dollar is helping to keep fuel prices down at the pumps. This is good news for motorists as it means petrol and diesel prices are unlikely to shoot up, in fact we may even see them come down very slightly in the next week or so.  “The price we will pay for fuel at the pump into 2018 very much hinges on how effective OPEC’s production cut continues to be in reducing the global glut of crude oil. The increased barrel price this is designed to create may also work against the group as it makes fracking for oil in the US more financially viable, which in turn may lead to America increasing its production and filling the gap from the cuts. If this happens it should mean forecourt prices won’t go shooting up.” Regional fuel price variation Yorkshire and the Humber endured the largest rise in unleaded pump prices with an average of 2.6p being added to a litre throughout November taking the price from 118.14p to 120.74. Scotland enjoyed the smallest increase – 1.9p a litre compared to the national average unleaded increase of 2.35p a litre, rising from 118.48p to 120.38p. Northern Ireland once again had the cheapest petrol, finishing the month on 119.74p. Across the UK the price of diesel went up by an average of 2.22p a litre, but in the South West the figure was 2.46p with a litre going up from 121.04p to 123.50p. London and Scotland had the joint lowest increase at 1.91p a litre. The South East continued to have the most expensive diesel with a litre costing 123.77p at the end of November. By way of contrast the average UK diesel price was 123.18p a litre, and the Northern Ireland low price was 121.93p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Unleaded price set to overtake diesel for the first time in over a year as US demand rockets&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Sep 01, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The RAC is warning drivers to expect a hike in unleaded petrol prices on the forecourt in the coming days, largely as a result of Storm Harvey in the southern United States. The price of a litre of petrol could rise by up to 4p per litre, which would take the average price of the fuel above 121p per litre – a price not seen since December 2014. RAC Fuel Watch data shows that this would also mean the average price of a litre of unleaded moves above that of diesel, something that has not been seen in the UK since early June 2016. RAC spokesman Pete Williams said: “The price of unleaded petrol will leapfrog diesel early next week, rising by up to 4p per litre as the impact of Storm Harvey and the shut-down of large refineries in the Gulf Coast drives up US demand for petrol imports. “The average price of a litre of unleaded on Thursday 31 August was 117.29p and diesel was 118.14p but we could see unleaded rise in the coming days to around 121p a litre, with diesel likely to stay stable around 118.5p. This will be the first time unleaded has been higher than diesel since June 2016 and we expect this to be the case for some time to come, or at least until the US oil industry is able to get refineries back into operation and production in the Gulf Coast returns to normal - to meet the United States’ immense appetite for gasoline. “One quarter of the refining capacity in the States remains offline leaving a shortfall of over four million barrels a day, and crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is down 13.5%. In response, oil traders are acting to redirect fuel to the US ahead of the busy Labor Day weekend surge in travel. “The price of a barrel of crude oil has also increased to $52.79 dollars following the catastrophic floods in Houston. Americans are wedded to their petrol engines and while they have been endeavouring to become more self-sufficient through increased fracking they are now having to buy more unleaded from overseas which is reducing the availability of unleaded for the rest of the world. “We have already seen the wholesale price of unleaded increase by 5p in just the last week and the ongoing crisis in the state of Texas could have a prolonged impact on demand and, in turn, the wholesale price – so we may see further price increases on UK forecourts.” Notes to Editors For all media\xa0enquiries,\xa0please contact the RAC\xa0press office team on +44 (0)1454 664 123.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;June sees forecourt fuel fall by 2p a litre for second month in a row&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jul 05, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;Fuel prices have fallen by 2p a litre for the second month in a row, data from the latest RAC Fuel Watch* report reveals. A litre of unleaded now costs an average of 114.71p compared to 116.69p at the start of June. Diesel has fallen slightly more at 2.2p a litre from 117.77p to 115.57p. The average price at Britain’s four major supermarkets is 111.73p for petrol and 112.32p for diesel.  The average price of fuel is considerably lower than it was in February when a litre of unleaded was around 120p and diesel 122p. This means a tank of petrol is now around £3 cheaper (£2.91) than it was in February and diesel £3.54 cheaper. Compared to May a tank of unleaded for a typical 55-litre family car is now £1.09 cheaper at £63.09 and the equivalent diesel fill-up is £1.21 less at £63.56. The reductions are a result of a mid-month substantial drop in the oil price which saw a barrel go as low as $44.23 on 20 June. Across the month the oil price fell by 6% – starting June at $50.12 a barrel and finishing at $47.13 – which in turn caused the wholesale price of petrol to reduce by more than 3p a litre. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “June has been a good month for motorists, bringing a 2p reduction in pump prices, following on nicely from a similar drop in May. As wholesale prices have come down in response to a falling oil price retailers have done the right thing and passed their savings on to motorists on the forecourt.  “It has also been good to see retailers bringing the price of diesel in line with petrol as the wholesale price of diesel has been cheaper than petrol for some considerable time and right now they are broadly the same. “But while it’s definitely positive to see pump prices so much lower than they were at the start of the year – especially with the summer holidays just around the corner – the overriding message to motorists has to be one of caution as it seems unlikely that the oil price will stay this low for very long. “Oil producers group OPEC has been trying to shore up the oil price for months but the market is still oversupplied, mostly as a result of the United States’ increased production from fracking together with increased output from OPEC producers Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the organisation’s productions cuts.” Regional fuel price variation The North East saw the biggest fall in the price of unleaded with a litre coming down by 2.2p in June from 116.2p to 114p. Northern Ireland, however, started and finished the month with the cheapest fuel in the UK, with a litre now standing at 113.79p. The South East was once again the most expensive at 115.26p a litre. London saw the greatest drop in the price of diesel with a litre reducing by 2.49p. The North East recorded the lowest end of month price at 114.46p and the South East the dearest at 116.23p.

Key facts:&quot;}, {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;RAC presses retailers to cut fuel prices as oil price slumps&#x27;, &#x27;date&#x27;: &#x27;Jun 08, 2017&#x27;, &#x27;content&#x27;: &quot;The RAC is calling on retailers to cut the price of fuel after a sudden drop in the price of oil has brought wholesale costs down. Oil dipped well below the $50 a barrel mark last Friday and has stayed there since leading to a significant reduction in the wholesale price of both petrol and diesel. This gives the supermarkets the opportunity to reduce their prices due to the fact they buy fuel more frequently than other retailers and will be already benefitting from lower wholesale costs. Petrol could be cut by 2p a litre while diesel, which should already have been reduced due to previous wholesale savings, could be cut by around 4p a litre across the country.   RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “We have been monitoring supermarket fuel prices closely since the oil price began to tumble hoping that we would see them come down, but sadly that has not happened yet. In fact, one even increased prices by half a pence a litre.  “The cost of\xa0a barrel of oil fell to $47.15 on Wednesday – the lowest price since early May – contributing to a 2p a litre reduction in the wholesale price of petrol since 24 May. In the same time period the price of wholesale diesel has come down by more than 3.5p a litre. “The average price of unleaded at the four major supermarkets is currently 113.55p in contrast to the national average of 116.49p, but the drop in the price they buy their petrol in at ought to mean that comes down to nearer 111p a litre.  “Supermarket diesel is on average 114.33p a litre at the moment when it should also be around 110.5p a litre as the wholesale price is now lower than that of petrol. The UK average for diesel is 117.56p a litre which is at least 4p too high which suggests non-supermarket retailers are charging more for diesel than they should be.  “We sincerely hope the reason that retailers have not passed on savings in the wholesale price to motorists at the pumps this week is nothing to do with them thinking that people are distracted by the General Election.” The fall in the oil price has been brought about by the fact the United States has been found to have more oil and petrol supplies than expected which has demonstrated that production cuts from OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), in agreement with other major producers, are not having the desired effect of reducing the oversupplied oil market.
